## [3.20.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **A symlinked scan root scanned nothing and reported clean.** `find` does not descend a start path that is itself a symlink, and both `main()` and `run_bulk_scan` normalised paths with the default **logical** `pwd`, which preserves the symlink. The result was the worst failure mode this tool has: a full pass, exit 0, `✅ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected` — for a tree that was never opened.
  - Measured on a real machine where `/work` is a symlink to `/Volumes/Work`: `--bulk --bulk-list /work` reported **`No projects found under: /work — nothing to do`**. After the fix, the same command discovers **698 projects**. A plain scan of `/work/<project>` likewise collected zero files.
  - Passing a trailing slash (`/work/`) does make `find` resolve the link, but the logical `pwd` strips it again, so that workaround failed identically — there was no way to scan such a root correctly.
  - Symlinked roots are ordinary, not exotic: `/work -> /Volumes/Work` and `/opt/<x> -> …` in corporate layouts, macOS's own `/tmp -> /private/tmp`, and anything bind-mount-shaped. `pwd -P` is now used in all three normalisation sites, so `find`, `GREP_BASE` and the reports all see a real path.

- **`--bulk` rows could contradict themselves, e.g. `🟡 MEDIUM RISK (H:4 M:0 L:0)`.** `trufflehog_activity.txt` stores `path:SEVERITY:message` and mixes HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW, but the `--save-log` and `--json` writers dumped the **whole file** into the HIGH bucket (`cut -d: -f1`, discarding the severity field). A file that merely mentions trufflehog is a MEDIUM finding, so it was recorded as HIGH.
  - In `--bulk` the row label comes from the child's exit code (correctly MEDIUM) while the counts are parsed from the log (wrongly HIGH) — hence rows that say MEDIUM next to `H:4`. `--json` was affected identically, marking every trufflehog finding HIGH, which matters more since that output is meant to be machine-consumed.
  - Each severity is now emitted into its own section, matching what `crypto_patterns.txt` already did. The `--json` message no longer carries a redundant `HIGH:`/`MEDIUM:` prefix.
- **`--bulk-output` inside a scan root was scanned as a project again.** `_bulk_resolve_abs` did not resolve symlinks, so once discovery started returning physical paths the two could not be compared — on macOS `mktemp -d` yields `/var/folders/…` while the physical path is `/private/var/folders/…`. Caught by the existing hardening test from 3.2.1.

### Added
- **Four assertions**: a symlinked root for both a plain scan and `--bulk` discovery, and trufflehog severity in both `--save-log` and `--json`. All fail on the unpatched code.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.19.0 → 3.20.0. Scan targets and bulk roots are now reported as their resolved physical paths.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 240.

## [3.18.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **A compromised package sitting on disk was invisible unless something declared it as a dependency.** `check_packages` extracted only `dependencies` / `devDependencies` blocks, so a `package.json`'s own `name` + `version` was never matched against the compromised list. `npm i -g keyv@6.0.0` produced `✅ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected` — the payload was installed, but no manifest pointed at it. The same blind spot covers any `node_modules` tree whose lockfile is absent, stale, or was regenerated after the fact.
  - This mattered most for the one directory people scan deliberately: `$(npm root -g)` is *nothing but* installed packages with no parent manifest, so the check that should catch a compromised global CLI was the check that could not run.
  - Manifests now contribute their own identity to the dependency set. Only the top-level `name`/`version` are used — nesting depth is tracked so a dependency literally called `name` or `version` cannot be mistaken for the manifest's own.
- **An ecosystem whose only markers live in an excluded directory is now detected.** `ECOSYSTEM_EXCLUDE_PATHS[npm]="node_modules"` stops vendored dependencies from activating npm for a project that does not use it — sensible when the project has manifests elsewhere. But when the *only* markers in the tree are inside the excluded directory, the exclusion removed the entire basis for detection and every npm check was skipped. Again this is precisely `$(npm root -g)`: users had to know to pass `--ecosystem npm`, and without it got a green result that meant nothing. Detection now falls back to the excluded paths when they are all there is. Projects with their own manifests are unaffected — the fallback only fires when the first pass finds nothing.

### Added
- **`test-cases/global-install-attack/`** (HIGH: a compromised package with no declaring manifest) and **`test-cases/global-install-clean/`** (same shape, last-known-good version — the identity match must not fire on the package name alone). Neither has a top-level `package.json`, so they also exercise the ecosystem-detection fallback. Plus assertions for the identity match and for npm activating on a `node_modules`-only root. Suite: 238 → 242 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.18.0.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 242.
## [3.17.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **`yarn.lock` was never parsed.** It was collected into the lockfile inventory and counted as an npm ecosystem marker, but `check_package_integrity`'s parser only understands JSON (`"node_modules/<pkg>":` blocks), so neither Yarn dialect matched anything. **A Yarn project pinning a compromised version reported `✅ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected`**, both directly and under `--bulk`. For a Rails / Shakapacker codebase that is most of the tree, and a clean bulk report was not evidence of anything.
  - `transform_yarn_lock` converts both dialects into the pseudo-`package-lock.json` shape the shared parser already consumes — the same approach `pnpm-lock.yaml` has used since 3.4.0. Both formats share the structure this needs: an entry header at column 0 ending in `:`, followed by an indented `version` line.
    - Yarn v1: `keyv@^6.0.0:` → `version "6.0.0"`
    - Yarn Berry: `"keyv@npm:6.0.0":` → `version: 6.0.0`
  - Multi-descriptor headers (`keyv@^6.0.0, keyv@^6.1.0:`) take the first descriptor, since they all resolve to the block's single version. Scoped names survive because the package name is everything before the *last* `@` (`@or-sdk/auth@^0.38.2` → `@or-sdk/auth`). Berry preamble blocks (`__metadata:`) have no `@` and are skipped.
- **The first package entry of every `pnpm-lock.yaml` was dropped.** `transform_pnpm_yaml` emitted bare `"<pkg>": {` keys, and the shared parser's legacy branch for that shape filters out structural JSON keys by an allow-list that does not include `packages` — so the pseudo-lockfile's own `"packages": {` wrapper was consumed as a package, swallowing entry #1. A lockfile whose only compromised package sorted first reported clean; adding any earlier entry made it appear. Both transforms now emit the unambiguous `"node_modules/<pkg>":` form.

- **A `yarn.lock` pin was reported as SAFE under `--check-semver-ranges`, not merely missed.** `get_lockfile_version` read the version off the entry *header* (`keyv@^6.0.0:`) with `sed 's/.*@\([^"]*\).*/\1/'`, which returns the requested range plus a colon — `^6.0.0:`. That was then compared against the compromised version, did not match, and the package was emitted as `ℹ️ LOW RISK: Packages with safe lockfile versions … (locked to ^6.0.0:, could match 6.0.0)` with exit 0. The identical project with a `package-lock.json` returned MEDIUM / exit 2. Resolution now goes through `transform_yarn_lock`, so the resolved version is read from the block's `version` line.
- **`npm-shrinkwrap.json` was never collected, so never parsed.** It is byte-compatible with `package-lock.json` and the parser already handles the format — it was simply absent from the file inventory and the lockfile filter. Added to both.

### Added
- **Five fixtures**: `yarn-lock-attack/` (Yarn v1, multi-descriptor header + scoped `@or-sdk/auth@0.38.2`), `yarn-berry-attack/` (Berry `name@npm:version` descriptors), `yarn-lock-clean/` (last-known-good version — a name-only match must not fire), `pnpm-first-entry-attack/` (compromised package first in the lockfile), and `npm-shrinkwrap-attack/`. Plus assertions pinning each finding and one guarding the `--check-semver-ranges` regression. All fail on the unpatched code. Suite: 238 → 249 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.17.0.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 249.

### Notes
- Lockfile matches are reported as MEDIUM (`Package integrity issues detected`), not HIGH — that is the existing severity for lockfile findings and is unchanged here. Worth knowing when triaging this wave, since a pinned compromised version in `yarn.lock` will not produce a red HIGH banner.
## [3.16.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **C2-rotation channel of the August 4, 2026 keyv/cacheable wave** (`check_keyv_indicators`). The 3.14.1 entry that added `npm-cache[.]com` noted its own weakness: *"the attacker rotates C2 via an Ethereum smart contract without changing the payload, so this specific domain may be short-lived."* The rotation mechanism itself was never matched. It now is:
  - **Contract `0xE1f2395ee43e45A1556EC6438a88c31B83493103`** — the address the payload reads its current exfil host from. Matched on its own (both the EIP-55 checksummed and all-lowercase forms, since Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive outside checksumming): a 40-hex address has no benign reason to appear in a dependency tree. This is the durable half of the indicator — it survives any number of domain rotations, where `npm-cache[.]com` does not.
  - **`eth-mainnet.nodereal[.]io`** — the RPC endpoint used to read the contract. **Reported only alongside another wave marker** (the contract address, `npm-cache[.]com`, `Shai-Hulud`, `Math_Symbol`, `math_init`). NodeReal is a legitimate infrastructure provider and this is an ordinary public Ethereum RPC endpoint used by real dapps and wallet tooling; matching it bare would flag benign web3 projects. The disclosed IoC is specifically an `eth-mainnet.nodereal[.]io` request *containing* `0xE1f2395e…`, i.e. the combination, so that is what is matched.
- **`test-cases/keyv-c2-rotation-attack/`** (HIGH: contract in both cases + corroborated RPC endpoint) and **`test-cases/keyv-c2-rotation-clean/`** (legitimate NodeReal RPC usage — must stay clean), plus four assertions in `run-tests.sh` pinning each IoC and the false-positive guard. Both fixtures are inert string constants. Suite: 238 → 244 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.16.0; `check_keyv_indicators`' header rewritten to describe all three network indicators rather than only the fallback domain.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 244.
## [3.15.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **`check_durabletask_indicators` reported HIGH RISK on any machine with an AI CLI installed.** The May 19, 2026 durabletask campaign fetches its stage-2 payload from `check.git-service.com` using the endpoints `/api/public/version`, `/v1/models` and `/audio.mp3`, and 3.5.0 matched those paths as **bare literals**. They are ordinary URL paths: `/v1/models` is the standard OpenAI- and Gemini-compatible inference endpoint, so it appears in every AI SDK and in vendored typings for them.
  - Observed on a stock developer machine: scanning `npm root -g` flagged `@google/gemini-cli`'s bundled `googleapis` typings (`build/src/apis/ml/v1.d.ts`) as a durabletask C2 reference, attaching the campaign's remediation text — *"rotate AWS/GCP/Azure/Kubernetes/Vault/GitHub credentials, audit AWS SSM + kubectl exec history for lateral movement"*. A signal that fires on essentially every developer machine carries no information, and sending teams into credential rotation over it is worse than not having the check.
  - **The endpoints are now reported only when the same file carries another campaign marker** (`check.git-service`, `t.m-kosche`, `rope.pyz`, `pgmonitor`, `pgsql-monitor`, `sys-update-check`, one of the three beacon strings, or `durabletask`). This deliberately preserves the one case a bare match caught and the C2 host literal does not: a variant that **rotates the C2 domain** while keeping the endpoints.
  - **Known residual gap:** a rotated C2 host with no other campaign marker anywhere in the same file is no longer reported by this check. The wave's `rope.pyz` hash, `pgsql-monitor.service` / `pgmonitor.py` / `~/.cache/.sys-update-check*` persistence artifacts, beacon strings and pinned `durabletask` versions all still apply, so the campaign remains covered by five independent signals.

### Added
- **`test-cases/durabletask-endpoint-fp/`**: benign AI SDK client code using `/v1/models`, `/api/public/version` and `/audio.mp3`, which must stay clean. Plus an inline assertion in `run-tests.sh` covering the corroborated case (rotated C2 host + endpoint + campaign marker in one file), so the false-positive fix cannot silently become a false-negative. Suite: 238 → 241 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.15.1.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 241.
## [3.15.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **The SHA-256 hash sweep skipped `node_modules/`, where npm payloads actually land.** `check_file_hashes` hashed only files *outside* `node_modules` plus an allowlist of known malicious basenames (`setup_bun.js`, `bun_environment.js`, `node-ipc.cjs`, `trap-core.js`, …). Since an npm supply-chain payload arrives inside `node_modules` by definition, the one place `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST` matters most was the one place it was not computed.
  - **Impact, Aug 4 2026 keyv/cacheable wave:** of its three payload hashes, only the `.claude`/`.vscode` loader variant (`fd3ca400…`) was reachable, because that one lands in the repository. The `setup.mjs` shipped in the npm tarball (`54dc7ea5…`) and the `Math_Symbol.js` / `math_init.js` Bun payload it drops (`9fc2570b…`) both live under `node_modules/<pkg>/` and were never hashed. Measured on the new fixture: 1 of 4 collected files hashed before, 4 of 4 after.
  - The allowlist could not have fixed this in general. Several waves stamp their payload into generically-named files — `index.js`, `main.js`, `package.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json` — which cannot be matched by basename without matching most of the tree.
  - **The sweep also drew from `code_files.txt`, which is filtered to `js|ts|json|mjs|cjs`.** That silently made the allowlist's non-JS entries unreachable: `rope.pyz` carries a hash in `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST` that could never match, and `kitty-monitor.sh` / `cat.py` / `pgmonitor.py` were excluded from hashing too (they are still matched by name elsewhere). Hashing is content-based, so restricting it by extension buys nothing; the source is now `all_files_raw.txt`.
  - Note this closes a *hash* gap only. Compromised-version detection already covered `node_modules` (transitive deps are parsed from lockfiles and nested `package.json` files), and the `"preinstall": "node setup.mjs"` hook check already read `node_modules` `package.json` files.
- **The hash intersection spawned one `grep` per hashed file** (~3.5 ms each). With the sweep restricted to a couple of hundred files this was merely wasteful; over a full tree it is fatal. Replaced with a single `awk` pass. Measured on a real 37,905-file project: **~216 s** for the per-file loop over that list, against **~0.14 s** for the single pass.
  - **Cost of the wider sweep**, hash phase end to end, macOS `-P 8`: on that 37,905-file project **~1.9 s → ~6.1 s** (235 → 37,905 files hashed); on a 36,930-file global npm root **~0 s → ~3.9 s**, where previously *nothing* was hashed at all. That is the price of the hash IoCs working; the intersection rewrite is what keeps it in seconds rather than minutes.
  - This also fixes filename truncation: the old `awk '{print $1, $2}'` cut every checksum line at the first space, so a finding in `my file.js` was reported as `my`. Checksum output is now split as "first field is the hash, the rest is the name", handling both the `<hash>  <name>` and `<hash> *<name>` forms.

### Added
- **`test-cases/hash-in-node-modules/`**: inert placeholder files under `node_modules/keyv/` mirroring where the keyv wave drops its payload, plus a coverage assertion in `run-tests.sh`. A fixture cannot carry a real malicious hash, so the test asserts that the hash sweep reaches every collected file rather than matching a particular hash. Fails on the unpatched code. Suite: 238 → 240 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.15.0. The progress line now reads `Checking <n> files for known malicious content (of <m> collected)` — previously `<n> priority files … (filtered from <m> total)`, which is no longer accurate now that nothing is filtered out.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 271 → 275.
## [3.14.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **keyv/cacheable wave list re-sync: +453 malicious versions across 301 packages.** The August 4 section was built from the Wiz IoC CSV as of upstream commit #31 (2026-08-04 12:55 UTC, 434 packages / 1,782 versions). Wiz kept enumerating the wave after publication; commit #32 (2026-08-04 16:45 UTC) grew the list to **443 packages / 2,235 versions**. Our keyv section now matches that snapshot exactly.
  - **9 newly listed package names**, all in a scope absent from the earlier snapshot: `@umacloud/cli-{darwin-arm64,darwin-x64,linux-arm64,linux-musl-arm64,linux-musl-x64,linux-x64,win32-x64}`, `@umacloud/knowledge`, and `umadev`.
  - The other **292 packages were already listed** and gained additional malicious versions — mostly late-numbered patch releases the worm published as it continued republishing (`@ornikar` +158, `@servicetitan` +141, `@or-sdk` +67, `@onereach` +27, unscoped +50, `@thiennq` +2).
  - Source (a moving target — re-pull before each sync): `wiz-sec-public/wiz-research-iocs`, `reports/keyv-packages.csv`.
  - Verified: zero duplicate entries file-wide, every added line matches the canonical `package:version` form, and every CSV entry is now covered by the list.

### Changed
- **`compromised-packages.txt`**: 5,246 → **5,699** entries; header count corrected from the stale `5,240+` to the exact total; keyv section header updated to 443 packages / 2,235 versions.
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.2 → 3.14.3.

### Notes
- Detection-only change; no logic was touched. A missing entry can only cause a missed detection of an already-public bad version, never a false positive.

## [3.14.2] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **The `git-grep` backend silently returned no matches, disabling every content-pattern check.** `git grep --no-index` only accepts pathspecs inside the directory tree it runs from and rejects absolute paths outright (`fatal: '…' is outside the directory tree` / `is outside repository`). `main()` resolves the scan directory to an absolute path (`scan_dir=$(cd "$scan_dir" && pwd)`), so every path handed to the `fast_grep_*` helpers was absolute. Those helpers discard git's stderr (`2>/dev/null || true`), so the failure surfaced as *zero findings* rather than an error.
  - **Impact:** git-grep is auto-selected whenever `git` is installed, i.e. the default on virtually every developer machine and CI runner. All ~20 content-matching checks — `check_keyv_indicators`, `check_network_exfiltration`, `check_crypto_theft_patterns`, `check_trufflehog_activity`, `check_destructive_patterns`, `check_ai_assistant_dropper`, `check_mini_shai_hulud_indicators`, and every other campaign-specific `check_*_indicators` (84 call sites) — reported clean on infected trees. Package-list, lockfile, hash and preinstall-hook detection were unaffected, as they use awk/bash lookups rather than the grep helpers.
  - The bug only stayed hidden because CWD-inside-a-git-repo-containing-the-target is the one case git grep accepts, which is exactly how the test suite invokes the detector (fixtures live under the detector's own repository). Running the documented `cd shai-hulud-detect && ./shai-hulud-detector.sh ~/project` lost the checks.
  - **Fix:** the git-grep backend now runs as `git -C "$GREP_BASE" grep` with paths relativized against the scan root (`grep_paths_to_base`) and re-absolutized on output (`grep_paths_from_base`), so callers keep receiving the absolute paths the reports, `--save-log` and `--json` contracts assume. Verified that explicit pathspecs are still searched regardless of `.gitignore`, so `node_modules/` coverage is retained.
  - Relativized pathspecs are emitted with a `./` prefix. Without it a scanned file literally named `:!<something>` would be parsed as git **pathspec magic** — `:!` is the exclude prefix — letting a malicious package ship one extra file to silently drop another from every content search. `./` forces literal interpretation.
  - The scan root reaches `awk` through the environment, not `awk -v`. `-v` assignments undergo escape-sequence processing, so a scan path containing a backslash (`/tmp/we\ird`) arrived as `/tmp/weird`, matched nothing, and degraded every search back to the original bug.
  - A scan root of `/` (reachable via `--bulk /`, a mounted volume root, or a container scan) no longer produces a `//` prefix that matches nothing.
- **`--check-host` could not read `$HOME/.claude/settings.json` on the git-grep backend.** The Nx Console persistence marker lives outside the scan root and is not addressable as a git pathspec at all, so the check silently never fired. `fast_grep_quiet` now falls back to plain grep for paths outside the base. The batch helpers divert such paths to a plain-grep pass as well: git aborts the entire invocation on the first unusable pathspec, so a single out-of-base path in a batch would discard results for every other file batched with it. No batch list contains one today — every entry comes from `find "$scan_dir"` — but the diversion keeps that from becoming a silent failure if one ever does.
- **Auto-selection now verifies the backend before trusting it.** `select_grep_tool` probes git grep against the actual scan root once per run (`git_grep_backend_works`) — searching one real file for a sentinel that cannot match, so exit 1 means "works" and 128 means "cannot address this tree" — and falls back to ripgrep/grep otherwise. Probing the scan root rather than a scratch directory is what makes pathspec-addressability failures visible at all. An explicit `--use-git-grep` is verified too and downgraded with a printed note: silently reporting a compromised tree as clean is worse than not honouring the flag.

### Added
- **Backend-parity regression tests** (`run-tests.sh`): scan out-of-tree fixtures in `$TMPDIR` from a neutral working directory and assert that all four backends (auto, `--use-git-grep`, `--use-ripgrep`, `--use-grep`) report the `npm-cache.com` C2 domain, that a `:!`-prefixed decoy file cannot suppress a finding, that a backslash in the scan path does not disable content checks, and that `--check-host` still reads `$HOME`. The block asserts its own precondition (`$TMPDIR` outside any git repository) and skips rather than passing vacuously, since that arrangement is exactly what hid the bug. All five git-grep assertions fail on the unpatched code. Suite: 238 → 245 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.1 → 3.14.2.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 238 → 245.

### Notes
- **Backend timings after the fix** (macOS, warm cache). Large trees still favour git-grep, which is why it remains the auto-selected default; small trees are dominated by per-invocation process startup, where git is the heaviest of the three. Measured on a 3,001-file tree: git-grep 32.4 s, ripgrep 40.1 s, grep 42.2 s. On a 2-file tree: grep 2.0 s, ripgrep 2.5 s, git-grep 3.2 s. The small-tree ordering is not a regression introduced here — the previous git-grep path was "fast" only because it aborted without searching anything.

## [3.14.1] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **keyv/cacheable wave C2 fallback domain `npm-cache[.]com`** (`check_keyv_indicators`): the August 4 wave's primary exfiltration is via GitHub dead-drop repos, but it also has a network fallback endpoint, `npm-cache[.]com:443/router`. The 3.14.0 entry deferred adding this "pending corroboration," citing GitHub-only exfil — that rationale was incorrect: **Wiz, Socket (which documents a `DomainSender` component resolving destinations via DNS), and Aikido all report the domain.** It is now flagged as a HIGH content IoC. The check matches only the full domain (`npm-cache.com` / defanged `npm-cache[.]com`), never bare `npm-cache`, to avoid false positives from legitimate npm cache paths.
  - **Caveat:** the attacker rotates C2 via an Ethereum smart contract without changing the payload, so this specific domain may already be dead. It is a genuine documented IoC, but version-pinned and hash-based detection remain the durable signals for this wave.
- **Test coverage:** `test-cases/keyv-shai-hulud-attack/` gains an inert `c2_inert.js` (the domain string in a comment/const only — no payload), and `run-tests.sh` gains one assertion for the C2 finding. Suite: 237 → 238 checks.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: added `check_keyv_indicators` (wired into temp-file init, the file collector, the advanced-detection stage, the HIGH-risk report, and `--json`); `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.14.0 → 3.14.1.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge/count 237 → 238.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **August 4, 2026 Shai-Hulud "Here We Go Again" — keyv / cacheable wave**: `compromised-packages.txt` gains **1,782 malicious versions across 434 npm packages** in nine organizations — the largest wave to date by install volume (**>2 billion monthly installs**). Entry point was the compromised GitHub account of the `keyv`/`cacheable` maintainer; `keyv@6.0.0` was published at 09:35 UTC and by 10:43 UTC the worm had republished eight further orgs at roughly one package per second each, driven by npm publish tokens harvested from the previous victim. Highest-volume packages: `keyv` (604M/mo), `flat-cache` (580M/mo), `file-entry-cache` (571M/mo), `cacheable-request` (137M/mo), `cacheable` (30M/mo). Secondary orgs by version count: `@servicetitan` (845), `@ornikar` (297, mostly shared build/lint configs reached as devDependencies), `@onereach` (208), `@or-sdk` (155), `@qlik` (28), `@hubsync` (27), `@nebula.js` (21), `@arv-bedrock` (10), plus `@picsart`, `@deliveroo`, `@adminide-stack`, `@workbench-stack`, `@thiennq`. `@or-sdk/auth` and `@arv-bedrock/auth-sso` are authentication libraries, so downstream exposure compounds. Zero overlap with any previously listed entry.
- **Payload hashes** added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`:
  - `54dc7ea54a1317cca0e890a2770630cf7fa6c97813e0cb9d2caa93012b350668` — `setup.mjs`, the npm tarball preinstall loader
  - `fd3ca4007b225fdf8de7af4345a19179d5efa8c4bb9205f88cda806e5684b1eb` — `setup.mjs`, the `.claude` / `.vscode` repository loader
  - `9fc2570b7cef51c1b8df116d144d11ff4096357be7d2c4c6367cfc2509cf1bcc` — `Math_Symbol.js` / `math_init.js`, the 727,680-byte Bun-compiled payload (ten AES-256-GCM blobs keyed by PBKDF2, salt `svksjrhjkcejg`, 200,000 iterations)
- **Test fixtures**: `test-cases/keyv-shai-hulud-attack/` (HIGH: five confirmed compromised versions including the scoped `@or-sdk/auth@0.38.2`, plus the `node setup.mjs` preinstall hook) and `test-cases/keyv-shai-hulud-clean/` (six verified last-known-good versions — must stay clean).

### Changed
- **`check_preinstall_bun_patterns` now matches `"preinstall": "node setup.mjs"`**, the delivery vector for this wave. The pattern previously only covered the November 2025 forms (`node setup_bun.js`, `node bun_installer.js`), so an August-wave `package.json` extracted from a tarball or vendored into a repo produced no preinstall finding.
- **`check_malicious_repo_descriptions` now matches the plain forward string `Shai-Hulud: Here We Go Again`.** The May 19 wave stamped this marker *character-reversed* (`niagA oG eW ereH :duluH-iahS`, already matched in `check_mini_shai_hulud_indicators`); the August wave uses the unreversed form on its GitHub dead-drop repositories, of which roughly 546–1,300 were created on August 4.
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.13.0 → 3.14.0.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered the two new `EXPECTED` fixtures plus a five-assertion content-IoC block. Suite: 230 → 237 checks.
- **`README.md`**: counters bumped (3,460+ → 5,240+, 230 → 237, coverage window now September 2025 → August 2026); new campaign-table row.

### Notes
- **Exfiltration uses no attacker-controlled domain.** Harvested credentials are RSA-4096 encrypted and pushed to GitHub dead-drop repositories, so there is nothing to blocklist at the network layer. (Aikido separately reported `npm-cache[.]com:443/router` for a variant; Socket and SafeDep observed GitHub-only exfil in the samples they analysed. It is not added as a C2 indicator here pending corroboration.)
- **Provenance is not a safety signal for this wave.** Poisoned releases carry valid npm OIDC provenance and SLSA attestation because the publishing CI itself was compromised.
- **The dead-man's switch fires on credential rotation.** Persistence is installed as `~/.local/bin/gh-token-monitor.sh` (macOS LaunchAgent `com.user.gh-token-monitor`, Linux systemd `gh-token-monitor.service`), polling GitHub every 60s and `eval`-ing an attacker-supplied handler when the stolen token is revoked. These paths were already covered by the existing dead-man's-switch check added for the May 11 wave. Rotate credentials only from a host verified clean.
- The `.claude/settings.json` (`SessionStart`) and `.vscode/tasks.json` (`runOn: folderOpen`) hooks planted in infected repositories are gated behind editor/agent workspace-trust prompts and only execute if the developer accepts.
- Counts are as of the Wiz Research IoC CSV at 2026-08-04 12:55 UTC. The wave was still being enumerated at that point — other trackers reported up to 868 package names — so expect follow-up additions.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Inline / minified `package.json` dependencies were silently skipped** (false negative + evasion vector): the npm dependency extractor was line-oriented — it only parsed dependencies when the `"dependencies"` / `"devDependencies"` object was pretty-printed with each entry on its own line. A `package.json` written with an inline object (e.g. `"dependencies": { "evil": "1.0.0" }` on one line, a single-dependency object, or a fully minified manifest) yielded **zero** extracted dependencies, so a compromised package there was never flagged and the scan reported clean. This was especially dangerous for **polyglot repos** — a Go / Ruby / Elixir / Rust / PHP project that also ships a JS frontend whose `package.json` happened to be inline would get a green light despite an infected npm dependency. The parser now buffers each file and explodes structural punctuation (`{` `}` `,`) before applying the line logic, so inline and multi-line forms parse identically. Ecosystem auto-detection and the per-ecosystem checkers were already correct; this was purely the JSON dependency parse. (The `package.json` dependency scope is unchanged: `dependencies` + `devDependencies`.)

### Added
- **Polyglot regression fixtures**: `test-cases/polyglot-go-infected-js/`, `polyglot-ruby-infected-js/`, and `polyglot-elixir-infected-js/` — each a clean non-JS project (`go.mod` / `Gemfile` / `mix.exs`) that also ships an **inline** JS `package.json` (in a subdirectory) pinning a compromised dependency (`@ctrl/tinycolor@4.1.1`, a purely version-matched classic with no content-IoC check, so the assertion exercises the dependency-parse path specifically). New assertion blocks confirm both that the non-JS ecosystem and npm are activated together and that the infected inline dependency is flagged.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: rewrote the `check_packages` dependency-extraction awk to be format-agnostic; `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.12.0 → 3.13.0.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered the three polyglot `EXPECTED` fixtures plus the cross-ecosystem / inline-parse assertion block. Suite: 221 → 230 checks.
- **`README.md`**: tests badge updated.

## [3.12.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Elixir / Hex.pm ecosystem support** (`mix.exs` / `mix.lock`): `parse_mix_exs` reads `{:name, "<req>"}` dependency declarations (stripping `~>`/`>=`/`==` operators best-effort; git/path deps without a version are skipped) and `parse_mix_lock` reads the authoritative resolved versions from the `{:hex, :name, "x.y.z", …}` entries. Matched against `hex:`-prefixed entries in the list; findings report as `[Hex] name@version`.
- **RubyGems / Bundler ecosystem support** (`Gemfile` / `Gemfile.lock`): `parse_gemfile` reads `gem "name", "<req>"` declarations (single quotes normalized, operators stripped) and `parse_gemfile_lock` reads the authoritative pinned versions from the `GEM`→`specs:` section (constraint lines whose version opens with an operator are excluded). Matched against `gem:`-prefixed entries; findings report as `[Gem] name@version`.
- Both ecosystems are auto-detected from their marker files (Hex excludes `deps/` and `_build/`; Gem excludes `vendor/`), are selectable via `--ecosystem=hex` / `--ecosystem=gem`, and dispatch through the existing `ECOSYSTEM_CHECK_FUNCTIONS` table. `SUPPORTED_ECOSYSTEMS` is now `npm, pypi, composer, crates, go, hex, gem`. No `hex:`/`gem:` entries ship yet (no documented Hex/Gem waves) — the infrastructure is in place for when one lands, exactly like Crates today.
- **Test fixtures** (inert): `test-cases/hex-clean/` (`mix.exs` + `mix.lock`) and `test-cases/gem-clean/` (`Gemfile` + `Gemfile.lock`) with realistic safe dependencies. New assertion blocks verify Hex/Gem auto-detection and prove the full match path end-to-end by pointing `SHAI_HULUD_PACKAGES_FILE` at a temporary list with one synthetic entry matching a fixture dependency — so the matcher is exercised without inventing data in the committed list — and confirm both fixtures stay clean against the shipped list.

### Fixed
- **`SHAI_HULUD_PACKAGES_FILE` override now applies to every ecosystem**: the per-ecosystem checkers (`check_pypi/composer/crates/go/hex/gem_packages`) and the npm join-table builder previously read the bundled `compromised-packages.txt` directly, so the 3.9.0 override only affected the npm in-memory map. The resolved path is now published once as `COMPROMISED_PACKAGES_FILE` (set by `load_compromised_packages`, defaulting to the bundled file) and all lookups read it. The npm join-table awk also now skips `composer:`/`crates:`/`go:`/`hex:`/`gem:` prefixed lines (previously only `pypi:`), so prefixed entries no longer leak in as inert junk lookup rows.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: added `parse_mix_exs`, `parse_mix_lock`, `parse_gemfile`, `parse_gemfile_lock`, `check_hex_packages`, `check_gem_packages`; registered `hex`/`gem` in `ECOSYSTEM_MARKERS`, `ECOSYSTEM_EXCLUDE_PATHS`, `SUPPORTED_ECOSYSTEMS`, `ECOSYSTEM_CHECK_FUNCTIONS`; taught `load_compromised_packages` the `hex:`/`gem:` prefixes (with counts in the load summary); added `mix.exs`/`mix.lock`/`Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` to the file-collector `find` allow-list and the per-ecosystem collection; `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.11.0 → 3.12.0. Expanded the "add an ecosystem" recipe comment to call out the `find` allow-list step and the `$COMPROMISED_PACKAGES_FILE` convention.
- **`README.md`**: new **Hex** and **Gem** rows in the Ecosystems table; added them to the intro and the prefix-format examples; tests badge updated.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered `hex-clean`/`gem-clean` `EXPECTED` fixtures plus Hex/Gem auto-detect + override-match + clean-against-shipped-list assertion blocks. Suite: 213 → 221 checks.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Go module ecosystem support** (`go.mod` / `go.sum`): the detector now parses Go modules and matches required/resolved module versions against `go:`-prefixed entries in `compromised-packages.txt`. `parse_go_mod` handles both the single-line (`require example.com/m v1.2.3`) and block (`require ( … )`) forms and ignores `// indirect` comments; `parse_go_sum` reads the resolved set, stripping the `/go.mod` suffix that go.sum appends to one of each module's two lines. Go versions keep their canonical leading `v` (e.g. `v1.2.3`, `v0.0.0-<pseudo>`, `v0.10.1-dev.20`) in both the parser output and the database so matching is exact. Auto-detected via `go.mod`/`go.sum` markers (excluding `vendor/`), selectable with `--ecosystem=go`, and dispatched through the existing `ECOSYSTEM_CHECK_FUNCTIONS` table. `SUPPORTED_ECOSYSTEMS` is now `npm, pypi, composer, crates, go`.
- **First Go entry**: `go:github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain:v0.10.1-dev.20` — the Cosmos-SDK Layer-1 module named in the June 25 Miasma LeoPlatform/RStreams disclosure (Socket), previously unmatchable for lack of a Go parser.
- **Test fixtures** (inert): `test-cases/go-attack/` (a `go.mod` requiring the compromised Verana module plus a `go.sum` pinning it — exercises both parsers) and `test-cases/go-clean/` (a `go.mod` requiring a non-compromised `v0.10.0`). A new assertion block in `run-tests.sh` verifies Go auto-detection, the `[Go]` compromised-module finding, and that the match fires from both `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: added `parse_go_mod`, `parse_go_sum`, and `check_go_packages`; registered the `go` ecosystem in `ECOSYSTEM_MARKERS`, `ECOSYSTEM_EXCLUDE_PATHS`, `SUPPORTED_ECOSYSTEMS`, and `ECOSYSTEM_CHECK_FUNCTIONS`; taught `load_compromised_packages` the `go:` prefix (with a `go:` count in the load summary); added `go.mod`/`go.sum` to the file-collector `find` allow-list and to the per-ecosystem manifest/lockfile collection; `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.10.0 → 3.11.0.
- **`README.md`**: new **Go** row in the Ecosystems table; added Go to the intro's ecosystem list; tests badge updated.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered `go-attack`/`go-clean` `EXPECTED` fixtures plus a Go content/parsing assertion block. Suite: 207 → 213 checks.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **June 17, 2026 — easy-day-js / Mastra AI wave (npm)**: detection for the supply-chain compromise of the `@mastra` npm organization, which Microsoft attributes to North Korea's **Sapphire Sleet / BlueNoroff**. In an 88-minute automated window the attacker republished the entire `@mastra/*` scope plus the top-level `mastra` / `create-mastra` packages, each with a single injected dependency: `easy-day-js`, a `dayjs` typosquat whose `easy-day-js@1.11.22` carries an obfuscated `postinstall` dropper (`setup.cjs`) that disables TLS verification, pulls a cross-platform infostealer from C2 `23.254.164.92:8000/update/49890878` (stage-2 beacon `23.254.164.123:443`), and runs it as a detached hidden process. `compromised-packages.txt` gains 145 version-pinned entries (141 `@mastra/*` packages + `mastra` + `create-mastra` + `easy-day-js@1.11.21`/`1.11.22`); a new `check_easy_day_js_indicators` function flags the near-zero-FP content IoCs (the injected dependency reference, both C2 IPs, the `/update/49890878` payload path, and the `node setup.cjs --no-warnings` hook). This is a DISTINCT campaign from the Miasma/Shai-Hulud lineage. Sources: [JFrog](https://research.jfrog.com/post/easy-day-js/), [StepSecurity](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/mastra-npm-packages-compromised-using-easy-day-js), [Orca](https://orca.security/resources/blog/mastra-npm-supply-chain-attack/).
- **June 25, 2026 — Miasma "Mini Shai-Hulud" LeoPlatform / RStreams wave (npm)**: detection for the Miasma/Phantom-Gyp self-spreading worm reaching the LeoPlatform and RStreams (AWS data-streaming) npm ecosystems plus a handful of unrelated packages. `compromised-packages.txt` gains 23 version-pinned entries (15 `leo-*`, 2 `rstreams-*`, `hexo-deployer-wrangler`, `hexo-shoka-swiper`, `prism-silq`, `serverless-convention`, `serverless-leo`, `solo-nav`). 13 payload/loader SHA-256 hashes (malicious `binding.gyp`, the `leo-*` `index.js` payloads, the `.claude/` & `.vscode/` auto-run hooks, and the decrypted Bun-bootstrap/main payloads) were added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`, and the wave's new near-zero-FP marker strings (`RevokeAndItGoesKaboom`, `Alright Lets See If This Works`, `thebeautifulmarchoftime`/`thebeautifulsnadsoftime`) were added to `check_hades_miasma_indicators`. The Go module `github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain@v0.10.1-dev.20` is named in the disclosure but not matchable (no Go ecosystem support). Source: [Socket](https://socket.dev/blog/miasma-mini-shai-hulud-hits-leoplatform-npm-packages-go-ecosystem).
- **Test fixtures** (all **inert** — version-pinned manifests + neutered marker strings in comments, no executable payload): `test-cases/easy-day-js-attack/` + `easy-day-js-clean/` and `test-cases/leoplatform-miasma-attack/` + `leoplatform-miasma-clean/`. Dedicated assertion blocks in `run-tests.sh` lock in the easy-day-js content IoCs (5) and the LeoPlatform package + marker IoCs (4).

### Changed
- **`compromised-packages.txt`**: header counter 3,290+ → 3,460+ (145 easy-day-js/Mastra + 23 LeoPlatform/RStreams entries).
- **`README.md`**: counters 3,290+ → 3,460+ and the packages badge 2,830+ → 3,460+; two new rows in the "what it catches" wave table (easy-day-js/Mastra, Miasma LeoPlatform/RStreams); added a "Sources we monitor for new waves" subsection to References (primary research teams + news aggregators).
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: `SCRIPT_VERSION` 3.9.0 → 3.10.0; added `check_easy_day_js_indicators` (wired into temp-file init, the file collector, the advanced-detection stage, the HIGH-risk report, and `--json`); extended `check_hades_miasma_indicators` with the June 25 LeoPlatform markers; added 13 LeoPlatform hashes to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered four new `EXPECTED` fixtures plus the two content-IoC assertion blocks. Suite: 194 → 207 checks.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **`--json FILE` structured output mode**: a new machine-readable output for CI gates and downstream tooling (e.g. a hosted scanning service) that needs findings as data rather than parsed console text. It mirrors the exact HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity mapping of `--save-log`, but **preserves the per-finding reason** that `--save-log` discards (the latter keeps only file paths via `cut -d: -f1`). Schema (`schema_version` 1.0):
  ```json
  {
    "schema_version": "1.0", "tool": "shai-hulud-detector", "tool_version": "3.9.0",
    "generated_at": "2026-06-26T00:00:00Z", "scan_path": "/path/to/project",
    "summary": { "high": 7, "medium": 0, "low": 0 }, "risk_level": "high",
    "findings": [ { "severity": "HIGH", "file": "package.json", "line": 6, "message": "axios@1.14.1" } ]
  }
  ```
  - **Best-effort `line` number** for package-shaped findings (`name@version`, `@scope/name@version`): the manifest is grepped for the package name, preferring the quoted name (`"axios"` matches the dependency line, not `"axios-attack-test"`) and falling back to the bare name for non-JSON manifests (`requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, …). `line` is `null` for prose findings or when no match is found. This lets a consumer place inline annotations (e.g. GitHub Checks API) on the offending dependency line.
  - **Correct escaping by construction**: findings are normalized to `severity<TAB>file<TAB>line<TAB>message` records and rendered through a single `jq` pass — JSON is never hand-concatenated in shell, so quotes/backslashes/Unicode in IoC strings cannot corrupt the output.
  - **Dependency boundary preserved**: `--json` is the only mode that requires `jq`; it fails fast with a clear message if `jq` is absent. The default offline text output keeps its zero-runtime-dependency guarantee. The exit-code contract (`0`/`1`/`2`) is unchanged and remains the authoritative CI signal; `--json` and `--save-log` can be used together.
- **`SHAI_HULUD_PACKAGES_FILE` environment override**: `load_compromised_packages` now reads its list from `$SHAI_HULUD_PACKAGES_FILE` when that variable is set and the file exists, instead of the default `compromised-packages.txt` next to the script. This lets a caller (e.g. a service syncing a live feed) point the scanner at a managed copy without overwriting the script's own directory. Unset by default and silently falls back to the bundled list if the override path is missing, so existing usage is completely unaffected.

### Changed
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: added a `SCRIPT_VERSION` constant (`3.9.0`, surfaced as `tool_version` in `--json`); added `write_json_file` plus the `_jf_emit` / `_jf_path` / `_jf_pathmsg` / `_jf_pathmsg_stdin` helpers (all reached only under `--json`, so the normal scan path is unaffected); wired the `--json` flag into argument parsing, `--help`, and the main scan flow; added the `SHAI_HULUD_PACKAGES_FILE` override in `load_compromised_packages`.
- **`README.md`**: documented `--json` in the flags table and added a "Machine-readable JSON output" section.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: added a `--json` test block (6 assertions: well-formed JSON, `risk_level`/`summary` on an infected fixture, per-finding message preservation, line-number accuracy, `--save-log`/`--json` path-set parity, and clean-project emptiness; skipped with a notice when `jq` is unavailable). Suite: 188 → 194 checks.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Miasma "Hades" PyPI-branch coverage (June 7, 2026)**: Added 37 malicious version entries across 19 PyPI packages from the Socket-disclosed wave of 448 coordinated artifacts (411 npm + 37 PyPI) published by the same "Miasma: The Spreading Blight" campaign. The PyPI branch is tracked as "Hades - The End for the Damned". Packages: `bramin`, `cmd2func`, `coolbox`, `dynamo-release`, `executor-engine`, `executor-http`, `funcdesc`, `magique`, `magique-ai`, `mrbios`, `napari-ufish`, `nucbox`, `okite`, `pantheon-agents`, `pantheon-toolsets`, `spateo-release`, `synago`, `ufish`, `uprobe`.
  - **Novel PyPI delivery — Python startup-hook ("`.pth`") execution**: each wheel ships a tiny `<name>-setup.pth` file. Python auto-executes any line in a `.pth` file that begins with `import`, so the hook execs an obfuscated `_index.js` loader at interpreter startup — triggering on a plain `import` with NO `setup.py`/build step and NO `preinstall`/`postinstall` hook to monitor. This is the PyPI analog of the June 3 npm "Phantom Gyp" `binding.gyp` trick.
  - **Payload hashes (SHA-256)** — wired into `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`: `c539766062555d47716f8432e73adbe3a0c0c954a0b6c4005017a668975e275c` (setup.pth hook, identical across all wheels), `dc48b09b2a5954f7ff79ab8a2fd80202bd3b59c08c7cdbc6025aa923cb4c0efe` (`_index.js` loader, 4.8 MB / 17 packages), `e1342a80d4b5e83d2c7c22e1e0aaa95f2d88e3dbf0d853a4994b180c93a4b17d` (`_index.js` loader variant, 4.7 MB / 2 packages).
  - **New content-pattern check `check_hades_miasma_indicators`** (near-zero-FP literal matches): the Hades dead-man's-switch token-nuke marker `IfYouYankThisTokenItWillNukeTheComputerOfTheOwnerFully`, the exfil-repo beacon/description `Hades - The End for the Damned`, and the C2 camouflage path `api.anthropic.com/v1/api` (a path under the legitimate Anthropic API host that is not a real endpoint). Exfil repos use Greek-underworld names (stygian, tartarean, cerberus, charon, styx, lethe, thanatos, persephone); persistence via `gh-token-monitor`, `~/.local/share/updater/update.py`, `.claude/setup.mjs`, and a `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` injector ("Run Copilot").
  - **Backfill of June 1/3 Miasma markers** that were previously documented but never actively matched: added `Miasma - The Spreading Blight` to the malicious-repository-description list and the `IfYouInvalidateThisTokenItWillNukeTheComputerOfTheOwner` token-nuke marker to active content detection.
  - Source:
    - https://socket.dev/blog/shai-hulud-descends-to-hades-miasma-pypi-wave
- **IronWorm ("Shai-Hulud's rustier cousin") coverage (June 3, 2026)**: Added 37 npm package versions from a distinct, concurrent campaign disclosed by JFrog — a Rust-based infostealer (with an eBPF kernel rootkit, Exodus-wallet seed-phrase theft, and Kubernetes/Vault targeting) pushed through packages all published by the npm account `asteroiddao` (operator `ocrybit`) across the weavedb / arnext / cwao / wdb Arweave-Web3 ecosystem (`weavedb-sdk`, `weavedb-sdk-node`, `arnext`, `cwao`, `wao`, `zkjson`, `aonote`, `fpjson-lang`, etc.). Delivery is a `preinstall: "./tools/setup"` ~976 KB ELF hook; the worm also rewrites existing GitHub Actions workflows for persistence. The operator leaked their own Ethereum address `0x7e28D9889f414B06c19a22A9Bd316f0AC279a4d6` (hardcoded BIP-39 seed in the exfil skip-list), which is now added to the known-attacker-wallet content check in `check_crypto_theft_patterns`. Fixtures: `test-cases/ironworm-attack/` (HIGH — 5 compromised versions plus an **inert** JS file carrying only the leaked wallet string) and `test-cases/ironworm-clean/`.
  - Source:
    - https://research.jfrog.com/post/iron-worm-shai-hulud-rustier-cousin/
- **Test fixtures**: `test-cases/hades-miasma-pypi-attack/` (HIGH-risk: 5 compromised PyPI versions plus an **inert** `.py` file carrying the token-nuke/beacon/C2 marker strings as comments — no executable payload) and `test-cases/hades-miasma-pypi-clean/` (last-known-good versions, one release below each compromised version). A dedicated assertion block in `run-tests.sh` locks in the four Hades content IoCs.

### Fixed
- **Digit-leading npm package names were silently dropped**: npm names may begin with a digit (e.g. `02-echo`), but the bare-entry branch of the package loader and the package.json lookup table both anchored on `^[@a-zA-Z]`, so such entries were neither loaded nor matched. Both now use `^[@a-zA-Z0-9]`. This restores the previously-uncounted `02-echo:0.0.7` entry (loader npm count 3200 → 3201) and is covered by the new `digit-name-package-attack` regression fixture.
- **Self-detection false positives when the detector is scanned (issue #146)**: when `shai-hulud-detector.sh` is vendored/cloned inside the directory tree being scanned, the scan no longer flags the detector's own files. Its `test-cases/` fixtures contain *real* attacker wallet addresses, fake Bun installers, and malicious workflow files by design, and its source / `CHANGELOG.md` / `compromised-packages.txt` carry IoC literals as data — so a plain project (e.g. a PHP app with the tool checked in alongside) was reported as HIGH RISK against the tool's own files. The collector now resolves the detector's own installation directory and excludes it from the file inventory and from the checks that run their own `find` (e.g. the GitHub Actions runner check), but only when the detector actually lives inside the scan root — so scanning an individual `test-cases/` fixture (as the test suite does) is unaffected. A regression test in `run-tests.sh` builds a project containing a working in-tree copy of the detector and asserts it stays clean.
- **Empty file list caused a current-working-directory scan (issue #148)**: when a scan target contained no files of a given category, the `fast_grep_files`, `fast_grep_files_i`, and `fast_grep_files_fixed` helpers piped an *empty* list into `xargs -0 <tool>`. GNU `xargs` (Linux) runs the command once on empty input with no path arguments, so `git grep --no-index` / `rg` fell through to recursively scanning the **current working directory** — producing false positives whose paths pointed at the launch directory (the detector's own `test-cases/`, `/tmp` contents, or, in `--bulk` mode, the report files it had just written). BSD `xargs` (macOS) does not run on empty input, so the bug was invisible on macOS. Each helper now reads its input first and returns early when empty, never invoking the grep tool with no paths. This is distinct from issue #146 (self-detection of a vendored copy): #148's fall-through scans the CWD regardless of the scan target. A cross-platform regression test in `run-tests.sh` shadows `xargs` with a sentinel stub, sources the real helpers out of the detector, and asserts empty input never reaches `xargs`.

### Changed
- **`compromised-packages.txt`**: backfilled two versions confirmed by authoritative enumerations but missing from the original imports — `@redhat-cloud-services/vulnerabilities-client:2.1.8` (completes JFrog's 96 versions / 32 packages for the June 1 wave) and `autotel-mcp:29.0.1` (present in Snyk's node-gyp zero-day listing for the June 3 Phantom Gyp wave). Header counter: 3,200+ → 3,290+ (37 Hades PyPI + 37 IronWorm npm entries + these backfills).
- **`README.md`** counter: 3,200+ → 3,290+; new campaign rows in the wave table (Hades + IronWorm).
- **`shai-hulud-detector.sh`**: registered `check_hades_miasma_indicators` in the advanced-detection stage; added the three Hades payload hashes to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`; added the two Miasma/Hades repo descriptions to `check_malicious_repo_descriptions`; and added the IronWorm operator wallet to the known-attacker-wallet list in `check_crypto_theft_patterns`.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered five new `EXPECTED` fixtures — `hades-miasma-pypi-attack`/`hades-miasma-pypi-clean`, `ironworm-attack`/`ironworm-clean`, and `digit-name-package-attack` — plus dedicated assertion blocks for the Hades content IoCs, the IronWorm package+wallet IoCs, the issue #146 self-exclusion regression, and the issue #148 empty-input/CWD-scan regression (one assertion per `fast_grep_files*` helper). Suite: 173 → 188 checks.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Miasma: Phantom Gyp self-spreading worm wave coverage (June 3, 2026)**: Added 286 malicious version entries across 57 distinct npm packages published in a rolling 2-hour burst by the same "Miasma: The Spreading Blight" campaign that hit `@redhat-cloud-services` two days earlier. First victim was `@vapi-ai/server-sdk` (408K downloads/month) at 23:30 UTC; within an hour ~50 packages in the `jagreehal` ecosystem (`autotel-*`, `awaitly-*`, `executable-stories-*`, `node-env-resolver-*`) plus `ai-sdk-ollama` (120K downloads/month) were republished by the compromised maintainer accounts. Cross-ecosystem: the worm also injects into RubyGems via `extconf.rb`.
  - **Novel delivery mechanism — "Phantom Gyp"**: a 157-byte `binding.gyp` file with the GYP command-substitution syntax `<!(node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo stub.c)` triggers code execution during `npm install`'s `node-gyp rebuild` step **without** declaring any `preinstall`/`postinstall` script in `package.json`. This bypasses every install-script monitor that only watches the `package.json` scripts block. First observed in-the-wild abuse of `binding.gyp` for supply-chain execution. Detection in this PR is version-pinned via the `compromised-packages.txt` list; a future scanner enhancement may add a `binding.gyp` content-pattern check for the `<!(node ...)` invocation.
  - **Payload hashes (SHA-256)**: `ef641e956f91d501b748085996303c96a64d67f63bfeef0dda175e5aa19cca90` (binding.gyp, 157 bytes), `5926b86b642e00672252953eb30d8f75cfb7797fe3118bd6fa2cfbee92905d61` (4.5MB obfuscated index.js root loader), `da39146ef451d1b174a24d00b1e2a45cd38d54e849737f8f35333dcb22175707` (668KB decrypted main payload). Obfuscation stack: ROT-9 through ROT-20 Caesar + `eval`, AES-128-GCM self-decrypting blobs with embedded keys/IVs, a 907-byte Bun runtime loader that fetches `bun-v1.3.13` from `oven-sh/bun` releases, and obfuscator.io wrapping a 2,306-entry encrypted string table on the main payload.
  - **Credential targets (20+ types)**: GitHub PATs and Actions secrets via `/proc/<pid>/mem` reads of `Runner.Worker`, AWS (env + IMDSv2 + ECS), GCP (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, service account keys), Azure (managed identity / IMDS), Kubernetes service accounts, HashiCorp Vault tokens, CircleCI, npm tokens, SSH keys, Docker socket creds (with host-socket container-escape attempt), 1Password, gopass, pass, and DB connection strings.
  - **Self-propagation**: validates each stolen npm token against the keyword `IfYouInvalidateThisTokenItWillNukeTheComputerOfTheOwner`, enumerates the victim's packages, injects the `binding.gyp` + `index.js` payload into fresh tarballs, and republishes — with Sigstore provenance forgery in CI environments. C2 beacon for channel checks: GitHub commit search for `thebeautifulmarchoftime` (unauthenticated). User-Agent spoofed as `python-requests/2.31.0` despite Bun runtime execution.
  - **Persistence (AI-assistant + editor poisoning via stolen GitHub tokens)**: `.claude/setup.mjs` (Anthropic Claude), `.cursor/rules/setup.mdc` (Cursor AI), `.vscode/tasks.json` with `runOn: folderOpen`, and `.github/setup.js` GitHub Actions workflow injector.
  - **Exfiltration**: HTTPS POST to GitHub Contents API `repos/liuende501/{repo}/contents/results/results-{timestamp}.json` with RSA-encrypted JSON envelopes. Repos under `github.com/liuende501` (236 at StepSecurity disclosure, 321+ at Snyk follow-up) are named after Dune (`atreides`/`fedaykin`/`sardaukar`) and mythology (`nemean`/`hydra`/`cerberus`/`chimera`) terms; 34 repo descriptions are tagged `Miasma - The Spreading Blight`; 195 carry the reversed beacon `niagA oG eW ereH :duluH-iahS`.

- **Test fixtures**: `test-cases/miasma-binding-gyp-attack/` (HIGH-risk, 5 compromised versions spanning `@vapi-ai/server-sdk@1.2.2`, `ai-sdk-ollama@3.8.5`, `autotel-mcp@28.0.3`, `awaitly-postgres@23.0.1`, `wrangler-deploy@1.5.5`) and `test-cases/miasma-binding-gyp-clean/` (last-known-good versions of the same package families, verified absent from `compromised-packages.txt`).

### Changed
- **`compromised-packages.txt`** header counter: 2,900+ → 3,200+ (file now contains 3,219 entries; 286 new + 2,933 prior).
- **`README.md`** counter: 2,930+ → 3,200+ on the lead-paragraph and detection-coverage descriptions.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered `miasma-binding-gyp-attack` (HIGH) and `miasma-binding-gyp-clean` (clean) in the `EXPECTED` array.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Miasma: @redhat-cloud-services npm scope compromise coverage**: Added 95 malicious version entries across 31 distinct npm packages published via the compromised `@redhat-cloud-services` scope on 2026-06-01. A compromised Red Hat employee GitHub account injected malicious code via orphan commits bypassing code review, then a malicious GitHub Actions workflow published backdoored versions with valid SLSA provenance attestations using OIDC `id-token:write`. The 4.2MB obfuscated `index.js` payload uses four layers of obfuscation (ROT-21 → AES-128-GCM → obfuscator.io → B5 cipher with PBKDF2 200k iterations) and operates as a multi-stage credential harvester targeting GitHub/CI tokens, AWS/GCP/Azure creds, Kubernetes, Vault, npm/PyPI tokens, SSH keys, Docker, and GPG. Novel technique: reads `/proc/<pid>/mem` targeting `Runner.Worker` process to extract live GitHub Actions secrets marked `isSecret: true`, bypassing log masking. Exfiltration via GitHub Contents API dead-drop (base64-encoded data written to victim-controlled repos). Persistence via `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart` hooks and `.vscode/tasks.json` `folderOpen` tasks. Self-propagating worm capability uses harvested npm tokens with `bypass_2fa` to republish backdoored packages autonomously. Two waves at 10:53 UTC and 13:44-13:46 UTC. ~80,000 aggregate weekly downloads. Wiz Research names this campaign "Miasma: The Spreading Blight".

- **Test fixtures**: `test-cases/redhat-miasma-attack/` (HIGH-risk, 5 compromised versions) and `test-cases/redhat-miasma-clean/` (safe prior versions).

### Changed
- **`compromised-packages.txt`** header updated: 2,800+ → 2,900+, date range extended to June 2026.
- **`README.md`** updated: version count 2,830+ → 2,930+, date range → June 2026.
- **`run-tests.sh`**: registered `redhat-miasma-attack` (HIGH) and `redhat-miasma-clean` (clean) in the EXPECTED array.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Two new package ecosystems: Composer (PHP / Packagist) and Crates (Rust / crates.io).** Both are first-class members of the ecosystem abstraction — auto-detected from marker files (`composer.json`/`composer.lock`, `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`), selectable via `--ecosystem=composer` / `--ecosystem=crates`, and parsed by pure-bash awk parsers (`parse_composer_json`, `parse_composer_lock`, `parse_cargo_toml`, `parse_cargo_lock`) with no PHP or Rust toolchain required. New `composer:vendor/package:version` and `crates:name:version` prefixes are recognised in `compromised-packages.txt`; `check_composer_packages` / `check_crates_packages` do the same sorted `comm -12` set-intersection used for npm/PyPI. The Composer manifest/lockfile lists exclude vendored copies under `vendor/`; Crates excludes build output under `target/`.
- **TrapDoor coverage (May 22-25, 2026 — TeamPCP / UNC6780).** First multi-ecosystem campaign in the database: 34 packages / 384+ versions across npm + PyPI + Crates.io stealing wallets (Solana/Sui/Aptos), SSH keys, AWS creds, GitHub tokens, browser DBs and env vars. Because **all** published versions of the campaign packages are malicious, `check_trapdoor_indicators` detects them version-agnostically by name-matching the 32 distinct package names against the parsed dependency set of every ecosystem (chain-key-validator and defi-threat-scanner overlap with the May 20 Web3/DeFi MCP wave and stay attributed there). It also matches the `P-2024-001` campaign marker, the Crates `build.rs` XOR key `cargo-build-helper-2026`, the "Universal AI Agent Extraction Framework" string, the `trap-core.js` payload, the C2-hosted framework docs (`AUDIT-MATRIX.md`/`BYPASS.md`/`PAYLOAD.md`/`SWARM.md`), and the GitHub-Pages C2 path `ddjidd564.github.io/defi-security-best-practices` (same `ddjidd564` account as the May 20 wave). The one disclosed concrete version (`pypi:eth-security-auditor:0.1.0`) is also pinned in the package list. No SHA-256 hashes were published for this campaign, so none were invented.
- **Laravel-Lang Composer tag-rewrite coverage (May 22, 2026).** An attacker with push access force-rewrote 700+ git tags across four community packages (`laravel-lang/lang` ~502 tags, `/http-statuses`, `/attributes`, `/actions`) so that **every** version resolves to a malicious commit and RCE fires on Composer autoload — defeating version pinning entirely. `check_laravel_lang_indicators` flags any dependency on the four packages regardless of version, and matches the `flipboxstudio.info` C2 (+`/payload`, `/exfil`), the `DebugElevator`/`DebugChromium` Windows infostealer strings, the `Chromium-DebugElevator` PDB hint, and the three disclosed malicious commit SHAs (searched in `composer.lock` `reference` fields too). The disclosed malicious tags are pinned in the package list as `composer:` entries (`laravel-lang/lang:15.29.5`, `laravel-lang/http-statuses:3.4.5`/`3.4.0`).
- **node-ipc backdoor coverage (May 14, 2026).** Three versions (`node-ipc:9.1.6`/`9.2.3`/`12.0.1`, published by the hijacked `atiertant` account) added to the package list. An obfuscated IIFE appended to `node-ipc.cjs` fires on every `require('node-ipc')` and DNS-exfiltrates credential files to `sh.azurestaticprovider.net` (37.16.75.69, suffix `bt.node.js`). The real `node-ipc.cjs` SHA-256 (`96097e06…`) was added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`; `check_node_ipc_indicators` matches the C2 host/IP and the unique `__ntRun` export marker + `qZ8pL3vNxR9wKmTyHbVcFgDsJaEoUi` key material. (Explicitly distinct from the unrelated 2022 node-ipc protestware.)
- **Bitwarden CLI coverage (April 22, 2026 — "Shai-Hulud: The Third Coming").** `@bitwarden/cli:2026.4.0` added to the package list; malicious for ~1.5h on npm as a downstream effect of the Checkmarx `ast-github-action` breach. `check_bitwarden_indicators` matches the `bw1.js` payload filename, the `audit.checkmarx.cx` C2 (94.154.172.43), and the beacon strings "Shai-Hulud: The Third Coming", "Would be executing butlerian jihad!", and "LongLiveTheResistanceAgainstMachines".
- **Nx Console 18.95.0 coverage (May 18, 2026 — TeamPCP; the GitHub-internal breach).** A trojan VS Code extension fetched a ~498KB payload from an orphan commit in the official `nrwl/nx` repo via `npx -y github:nrwl/nx#558b09d7`, stole developer + cloud secrets, and specifically targeted `~/.claude/settings.json`. `check_nx_console_indicators` matches the orphan-commit SHA `558b09d7ad0d1660e2a0fb8a06da81a6f42e06d2`, its tree `ba642fe2…`, the `github:nrwl/nx#558b09d7` npx ref, and the unique `__DAEMONIZED=1` / `install-mcp-extension` / `nxConsole.mcpExtensionInstalledSha` / `firedalazer` markers. The three payload SHA-256s (VSIX, `index.js`, `main.js`) were added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`. Its `kitty-monitor`/`cat.py`/`.gh_update_state` persistence is the **same** as the May 19 Mini Shai-Hulud wave and is already caught by `--check-host`.
- **Generic AI-assistant config-dropper check (`check_ai_assistant_dropper`).** New cross-cutting detection for the May 2026 theme of weaponising AI coding assistants: (a) malicious `.cursorrules` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` droppers carrying the TrapDoor extraction-framework markers; (b) the `mouse5212-super-formatter` "Malware-Slop" npm package (May 26, 2026) that abuses Claude's `/mnt/user-data` upload directory and ships the attacker's own hard-coded GitHub PAT (account `unplowed3584`); and (c) with `--check-host`, inspection of `~/.claude/settings.json` for the Nx Console payload's persistence markers.
- **New SHA-256 hashes** in `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST` (16 → 20): `node-ipc.cjs` backdoor (Datadog), and the Nx Console `index.js` / `main.js` / VSIX payloads (Ox Security).
- **`collect_all_files`** now also collects `*.cjs` (into `code_files`), `*.php` (into `script_files`), `composer.json`/`composer.lock`, `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`, the AI-config filenames (`.cursorrules`/`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`), and the new payload filenames (`node-ipc.cjs`, `bw1.js`, `trap-core.js`, `AUDIT-MATRIX.md`, `SWARM.md`). `node-ipc.cjs`, `bw1.js`, and `trap-core.js` were added to the hash-priority filter so they're hashed even inside dependency trees.
- **Seven new test fixtures**: `trapdoor-attack` (npm+PyPI+Crates name match + content markers + `.cursorrules` dropper), `laravel-lang-attack` (Composer name match + exact version + C2/payload/commit-SHA), `node-ipc-attack`, `bitwarden-attack`, `nx-console-attack`, `malware-slop-attack`, and `composer-crates-clean` (negative test that the two new ecosystems are detected and produce zero findings on safe versions).

### Changed
- **Package count**: `compromised-packages.txt` expanded by 8 exact-version entries (`@bitwarden/cli`, `node-ipc` ×3, `eth-security-auditor`, `laravel-lang/*` ×3). The bulk of the new coverage (TrapDoor's 32 names, Laravel-Lang's 4 packages across all tags) is version-agnostic by design and lives in the dedicated `check_*_indicators` functions rather than per-version entries.
- **`SUPPORTED_ECOSYSTEMS`**: `npm pypi` → `npm pypi composer crates`. The loader's startup summary now reports composer/crates counts.
- **Stage 5/6 banner** now lists `trapdoor`, `laravel-lang`, `node-ipc`, `bitwarden`, `nx-console`, and `ai-droppers`.
- **Test count**: 122 → 169 (+7 fixtures registered in the EXPECTED table, +40 new content-IoC / negative / regression assertions across the six campaigns, the clean ecosystem fixture, and the `--ecosystem=all` set-e regression).

### Fixed
- **`--ecosystem=all` (and explicit `--ecosystem=<eco>` for an ecosystem with no marker files) aborted after Stage 1** under `set -eo pipefail`: `ecosystem_banner`'s per-ecosystem marker count ran a `grep | grep -v | wc -l` pipeline whose leading `grep` exits non-zero on no match, tripping `set -e`. Pre-existing, but newly prominent now that `--ecosystem=all` activates four ecosystems (most projects use one or two). The count is now guarded with `|| true` + a default so the banner — and the full scan — always completes.

### Security
- Added high-confidence detection for six newly disclosed campaigns and two new ecosystems, documented in:

## [3.4.3] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Paranoid-mode `rn` confusable-substring false positive**: `check_typosquatting`'s confusable-character check used a bare substring match — any package name containing `rn`, `vv`, `cl`, `ii`, `nn`, or `oo` was flagged as a potential typosquat. That correctly catches real typosquats like `rnodule` (which substitutes `rn` for `m` to impersonate `module`), but also produced a flood of false positives on every legitimate name that happens to contain one of those bigrams: `yarn`, `intern`, `return`, `learn`, `barn`, `modern`, and dozens of others. The intent of the check has always been to detect character substitutions that produce known popular package names, but the original implementation parsed the substitution target (e.g. `:m` in `rn:m`) without ever using it. The check now actually applies the substitution and only flags the name if the result matches a popular package — so `cornrnander` still triggers a warning ("resembles popular package `commander`") but `yarn` (substituted form `yam`) does not.
- **Regression test**: New `test-cases/paranoid-confusable-fp/` fixture mixes four legitimate names containing confusable bigrams (`yarn`, `intern`, `return`, `modern`) with one synthetic typosquat (`cornrnander`). A new paranoid-mode assertion block in `run-tests.sh` verifies that `cornrnander` is flagged ("resembles popular package commander") and that none of the four legitimate names are flagged. Six new assertions in total.

### Changed
- **Test count**: 116 → 122 (+1 fixture entry + 5 paranoid-mode assertions: 1 positive + 4 negative).
- **Confusable check finding text**: now includes the substituted form and the popular package it resembles, e.g. `Potential typosquatting via 'rn'->'m' substitution: 'cornrnander' resembles popular package 'commander'`, so users can immediately judge whether the finding is a real typosquat or a false positive.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **sl4x0 dependency-confusion campaign coverage (June 2025 → March 2026)**: SafeDep documented a sustained dependency-confusion operation targeting Fortune 500 companies. 92+ packages published across 32 throwaway accounts (all under `*@sl4x0.xyz` email domain; account names follow `<target>poc` convention). Payload is DNS-only reconnaissance — reads OS username + hostname + cwd basename + timestamp and exfils via DNS query to `oob.sl4x0.xyz`. No persistence, no file or credential theft. Likely security research / bug bounty given the explicit "poc" naming, but the code DID execute on install and leak developer identity to a third party.
  - **22 still-live `name:version` entries** added to `compromised-packages.txt` (the 70+ already-removed packages are caught by the publisher-fingerprint check below): `oc-aa-module-client@9.9.10`, `oc-navbar-module-client@9.9.10`, `oc-ccp-module-client@9.9.10`, `oc-pdc-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-conversation-history-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-ecm-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-cip-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-recommendedupgrade-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-agent-toolbar-module-client@9.9.0`, `oc-pico-module-client@9.9.0`, `@phonos/types@9.9.10`, `@wame/ngx-frf-utilities@9.9.11`, `@wame/ngx-adfs@9.9.11`, `cclr-component-resources@9.9.10`, `@ceeferenderer/itg-renderer-sdk@99.9.9`, `@ceeferenderer/fe-renderer-sdk@99.9.9`, `cr-static-shared-components@9.9.9`, `@the-coca-cola-company/ngps-global-common-utils@9.9.9`, `@the-coca-cola-company/receipt-scanner-admin-lib@9.9.9`, `@cloudsop/hmoment@9.9.9`, `tombac-chronos@9.9.9`, `ftapi-core@99.9.9`.
  - **New `check_sl4x0_indicators` function** matches: C2 domain `oob.sl4x0.xyz` (bare and defanged), publisher email-domain fingerprint `@sl4x0.xyz` (catches every package the campaign has ever published, including the 70+ removed ones, as long as the cached package.json is on disk), fabricated GitHub org `slaxorg`, and the two unique hex-named payload helpers `lib/b02e30.js` and `lib/6ad264.js`.
  - **New `test-cases/sl4x0-attack/`** fixture with a synthetic `node_modules/oc-aa-module-client/` layout exercising every IoC class.
  - Source: https://safedep.io/sl4x0-dependency-confusion-campaign/
- **art-template npm hijack coverage (March 2025 → May 2026)**: Compromised maintainer account (`daughtrymom` on npm, `goofychris` on GitHub — renamed from `aui` in late November 2024) injected a stage-1 loader into the package's browser bundle (`lib/template-web.js`). Payload chain-loads an iOS browser exploit kit attributed by Google TAG to the Chinese financially-motivated threat actor UNC6691. Distinct from TeamPCP / Mini Shai-Hulud / Megalodon / Polymarket / sl4x0 — no actor or infrastructure overlap.
  - **4 versions** added to `compromised-packages.txt`: `art-template@4.13.3`, `art-template@4.13.4`, `art-template@4.13.5`, `art-template@4.13.6`.
  - **2 stage-2/4 payload SHA-256 hashes** added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`: `d8e3973a…` (stage-2 jia.js/art.js loader) and `f31bdd06…` (stage-4 loader `49554fde7424c31c.js`). Priority-files filter extended so these are hashed even inside `node_modules/`.
  - **New `check_art_template_indicators` function** matches: C2 domains `v3.jiathis.com`, `git.youzzjizz.com`, `utaq.cfww.shop`, `l1ewsu3yjkqeroy.xyz` (all with defanged variants), API endpoint `/api/ip-sync/sync`, threat-actor publisher fingerprints (`v4v5qc`, `npmpacketmaintainmember7`, `daughtrymom` in `_npmUser` metadata; `goofychris` in GitHub URL references; `eb8org@gmail.com`, `npmpacketmaintainmember7@proton.me` email addresses), and the obfuscation seed `cecd08aa6ff548c2`.
  - **New `test-cases/art-template-attack/`** fixture with a synthetic `node_modules/art-template/` layout (minified-JSON `_npmUser` to match npm's post-install cache format).
  - Important note: payload activates ONLY in browser context (no preinstall/postinstall). Node.js server-side consumers are unaffected unless they explicitly load the browser bundle.
  - Source: https://safedep.io/art-template-npm-supply-chain-compromise
- **durabletask PyPI compromise coverage (May 19, 2026)**: Three malicious `durabletask` versions published within 35 minutes by a compromised maintainer. Runtime dropper injected at module import time downloads stage-2 payload (`rope.pyz`) from `check.git-service.com` and exfiltrates multi-cloud credentials (AWS / Azure / GCP across all profiles + regions, Kubernetes secrets across all contexts/namespaces, HashiCorp Vault KV, password-manager vaults including 1Password / Bitwarden / pass / gopass, SSH keys, Docker creds, npm/PyPI/Cargo tokens, kubeconfig, Terraform state, VPN configs Tailscale + WireGuard, MCP server configs, `.env` files, shell history, GitHub tokens). Worm capabilities: lateral movement via AWS SSM `SendCommand` (up to 5 EC2 instances) and Kubernetes `kubectl exec` (up to 5 pods). Slavic-folklore beacon strings (FIRESCALE, BABA-YAGA-KOSCHEI, "PUSH UR T3MPRR") in commit messages and exfil repos.
  - **Notable**: secondary C2 is `t.m-kosche.com` — **the same C2 as the May 19 Mini Shai-Hulud atool/AntV wave** (already covered by `check_mini_shai_hulud_indicators`). Strong toolkit overlap with TeamPCP suspected but not asserted in the disclosure.
  - **3 PyPI versions** added to `compromised-packages.txt`: `pypi:durabletask:1.4.1`, `pypi:durabletask:1.4.2`, `pypi:durabletask:1.4.3`.
  - **1 stage-2 payload SHA-256** added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`: `069ac1dc7f7649b76bc72a11ac700f373804bfd81dab7e561157b703999f44ce` (the `rope.pyz` downloaded from C2). Priority-files filter extended so it's hashed even inside virtualenvs / site-packages.
  - **New `check_durabletask_indicators` function** matches: primary C2 `check.git-service.com` (and defanged), C2 endpoints `/api/public/version`, `/v1/models`, `/rope.pyz`, `/audio.mp3`, the three beacon strings, the `rope.pyz` filename anywhere in the tree, and the persistence artifacts `pgsql-monitor.service` + `pgmonitor.py` + `~/.cache/.sys-update-check{,-k8s}` markers (both as direct path lookups and as anywhere-in-tree filename matches). The check scans code, script, AND yaml file lists so Python `__init__.py` injection points get caught.
  - **New `test-cases/durabletask-attack/`** fixture with `pyproject.toml` + synthetic `site-packages/durabletask/__init__.py` + `pgsql-monitor.service` exercising every IoC class.
  - Source: https://safedep.io/malicious-durabletask-pypi-supply-chain-attack
- **`run-tests.sh` content-IoC assertion blocks** for all three new campaigns: 6 assertions for sl4x0, 9 for art-template, 10 for durabletask. Total: 25 new positive assertions plus 3 new EXPECTED-table fixtures (`sl4x0-attack`, `art-template-attack`, `durabletask-attack`).

### Changed
- **Package Count**: Expanded `compromised-packages.txt` from 2,800 to 2,829 confirmed package versions (+22 sl4x0 + 4 art-template + 3 durabletask).
- **`MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`**: 11 → 14 hashes (+ art-template stage-2 + art-template stage-4 + durabletask rope.pyz).
- **`collect_all_files`**: extended with `b02e30.js`, `6ad264.js`, `49554fde7424c31c.js`, `rope.pyz`, `pgmonitor.py`, `pgsql-monitor.service`, `template-web.js` so the new filename-based artifact matches have something to find.
- **`check_file_hashes` priority filter**: now also covers `49554fde7424c31c.js`, `rope.pyz`, `template-web.js`, `pgmonitor.py` — so they're hashed even inside `node_modules/` / site-packages.
- **Stage 5/6 banner**: now lists `sl4x0`, `art-template`, and `durabletask` alongside the existing campaign checks.
- **Test count**: 88 → 116 (+3 fixtures, +25 content-IoC assertions).

### Security
- Added high-confidence detection for three additional campaigns documented in:
  - https://safedep.io/sl4x0-dependency-confusion-campaign/
  - https://safedep.io/art-template-npm-supply-chain-compromise
  - https://safedep.io/malicious-durabletask-pypi-supply-chain-attack

## [3.4.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Polymarket wallet-drainer typosquat coverage (May 21, 2026)**: Nine npm packages from the attacker-controlled `polymarketdev` account impersonate legitimate Polymarket trading tools. The postinstall hook prompts the user through a fake "wallet onboarding" UI, captures raw private keys, and exfiltrates them (plus env vars and `.env` files) to a Cloudflare Workers C2. Distinct from Megalodon and Mini Shai-Hulud — no shared attribution or infrastructure.
  - **18 compromised version artifacts** across 9 packages added to `compromised-packages.txt` (each package has exactly two published versions, `0.1.0` and `0.1.1`, verified against npm's registry on 2026-05-21):
    - `polymarket-trading-cli:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-terminal:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-trade:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-auto-trade:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-copy-trading:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-bot:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-claude-code:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-ai-agent:0.1.0/0.1.1`
    - `polymarket-trader:0.1.0/0.1.1`
  - **New `check_polymarket_indicators` function** in `shai-hulud-detector.sh` matches:
    - C2 host `polymarketbot.polymarketdev.workers.dev` (and defanged form `polymarketbot.polymarketdev[.]workers[.]dev`)
    - Exfiltration endpoint path `/v1/wallets/keys`
    - Payload SHA-256 `e01b85c1437085a519217338fe4ee5ed7858c28a10f8c1477b2f1857c3386edb` as a literal-string reference (incident-response notes, advisories checked into the repo)
    - Threat-actor publisher fingerprint `"_npmUser":{"name":"polymarketdev"` matched in JSON context (mirrors the `atool`-publisher detection approach from the May 19 wave to avoid bare-name false positives)
    - Attacker GitHub source repo reference `texsellix/polymarket-trading-bot`
    - Local-artifact paths `~/.polybot/device.json` and `~/.polybot/wallets.json` (the dropper's staging files for harvested wallet keys), both as direct path lookups under the scan root and as anywhere-in-tree regex matches against `/\.polybot/(device|wallets)\.json$`
  - **New `test-cases/polymarket-attack/` fixture** pins `polymarket-bot@0.1.0`, includes a `postinstall-trace.js` carrying every content IoC as inert string constants, and includes a synthetic `.polybot/wallets.json` to exercise the staging-artifact match end-to-end.
- **`run-tests.sh` content-IoC assertion block for Polymarket**: 7 new positive assertions covering every IoC class added above. Layout mirrors the existing Megalodon and atool/AntV assertion blocks.

### Changed
- **Package Count**: Expanded `compromised-packages.txt` from 2,782 to 2,800 confirmed package versions (+18 Polymarket entries).
- **Stage 5/6 banner**: Now also lists `polymarket` alongside the existing campaign checks.
- **Test count**: 80 → 88 (+1 new fixture, +7 new content-IoC assertions).

### Security

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Megalodon GitHub-repo backdooring campaign coverage (May 18, 2026)**: Megalodon is a distinct campaign — no asserted attribution, different infrastructure from Mini Shai-Hulud — that injected malicious CI workflow files into 5,561 GitHub repositories over a six-hour window via stolen GitHub PATs and deploy keys. The mass variant injects `.github/workflows/ci.yml` named `SysDiag`; the Tiledesk-targeted variant injects `.github/workflows/docker-community-worker-push-latest.yml` named `Optimize-Build`. Both base64-decode a bash payload that exfiltrates CI secrets, AWS/GCP/Azure/Kubernetes/Vault/Terraform/Docker credentials, SSH keys, and OIDC tokens to `216.126.225.129:8443`. Primary attack surface is server-side (GitHub repo and Actions runtime), but the workflow files become locally visible when contaminated repos are checked out, and one npm package picked up the contamination as fallout.
  - **`@tiledesk/tiledesk-server`** versions `2.18.6`, `2.18.7`, `2.18.8`, `2.18.9`, `2.18.10`, `2.18.11`, `2.18.12` added to `compromised-packages.txt` (Tiledesk maintainer published from their backdoored repo, bundling the malicious workflow into the npm tarball).
  - New `check_megalodon_indicators` function in `shai-hulud-detector.sh` matches:
    - `name: SysDiag` and `name: Optimize-Build` in any `.github/workflows/*.yml` (both are unique-enough names that a literal match is HIGH-confidence)
    - C2 IP literal `216.126.225.129` (bare, with `:8443` port, and defanged `216.126.225[.]129` form) across code + YAML + script files
    - Known malicious commit SHA `acac5a9854650c4ae2883c4740bf87d34120c038` (Tiledesk variant) across the same file set
  - New `test-cases/megalodon-attack/` fixture combining the contaminated Tiledesk version + a synthetic `SysDiag` workflow file carrying all four content IoCs (inert; the actual base64-bash execution is replaced with a harmless `echo`)
  - Source: https://safedep.io/megalodon-mass-github-repo-backdooring-ci-workflows/
- **Web3/DeFi MCP-server typosquatting campaign coverage (May 20, 2026)**: 10 npm packages masquerading as Web3/DeFi developer security tools (MCP servers). Distinct from Megalodon and Mini Shai-Hulud — no shared attribution or infrastructure. The payload runs on install AND on every MCP tool invocation, exfiltrating `~/.ssh`, `~/.ethereum`, `~/.bitcoin`, `~/.env`, `~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`, `~/.git-credentials` to a GitHub Pages dynamic-webhook C2 with a `webhook.site` fallback.
  - Ten compromised versions added to `compromised-packages.txt`: `chain-key-validator:0.2.3`, `defi-env-auditor:0.3.2`, `wallet-security-checker:1.0.3`, `crypto-credential-scanner:2.0.2`, `web3-secrets-detector:1.2.6`, `solidity-deploy-guard:0.4.4`, `mnemonic-safety-check:0.5.2`, `eth-wallet-sentinel:1.0.9`, `deployment-key-auditor:0.7.3`, `defi-threat-scanner:2.1.2`.
  - New `check_web3_mcp_indicators` function matches the primary C2 (`ddjidd564.github.io/defi-security-best-practices/config.json`, including defanged form `ddjidd564[.]github[.]io`) and the fallback webhook (`webhook.site/8d334534-1c63-4f4f-a0d7-95c446c8b233` and the bare UUID) across code files.
  - New `test-cases/web3-mcp-attack/` fixture pins `chain-key-validator@0.2.3` and includes a `postinstall-trace.js` file carrying the C2 / fallback URLs as inert string constants.
  - Source: SafeDep X post 2026-05-21 01:00 UTC (@safedepio) — no long-form blog post yet; package names + versions + C2 endpoints verified from the disclosure screenshot.
- **`run-tests.sh` content-IoC assertion block for Megalodon + Web3-MCP**: 7 new positive assertions that each new IoC produces a specific finding-line substring in the detector output. Layout mirrors the existing May 19 atool/AntV assertion block.

### Changed
- **Package Count**: Expanded `compromised-packages.txt` from 2,765 to 2,782 confirmed package versions (+7 Tiledesk + 10 Web3 MCP typosquats).
- **Stage 5/6 banner**: Now lists `megalodon` and `web3-mcp` alongside the existing campaign checks.
- **Test count**: 71 → 80 (+2 new fixtures, +7 new content-IoC assertions).

### Security

  - SafeDep X post 2026-05-21 (@safedepio) — package + IoC inventory for the 10-MCP-server wave

## [3.3.1] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Mini Shai-Hulud AntV/atool wave content-pattern IoCs**: PR #136 added the 643 compromised `package:version` entries for the May 19 wave but left the detector script unchanged, which meant a host where the dropper had landed but the compromised npm package had already been uninstalled would still slip past detection. This release extends `check_mini_shai_hulud_indicators` with the May 19 IoCs that don't depend on the package list:
  - **New C2 domain**: `t.m-kosche.com` (the OpenTelemetry-disguised exfiltration endpoint at `/api/public/otel/v1/traces`)
  - **Exfil-repo beacon string**: `niagA oG eW ereH :duluH-iahS` (character-reversed "Shai-Hulud: Here We Go Again", stamped on every fallback exfiltration repo)
  - **Threat-actor publisher fingerprint**: `"_npmUser":{"name":"atool"` — matched in JSON publisher-metadata context (quoted) to avoid false positives on bare `atool` text
  - **Forged commit-author email**: `huiyu.zjt@ant.com` (impostor identity used on the malicious `antvis/G2` commits)
  - **C2 dead-drop trigger keyword**: `firedalazer` (the payload polls GitHub's commit-search API for commits matching this exact word to receive RSA-PSS-signed C2 commands)
  - **Three malicious orphan-commit SHAs in `antvis/G2`**: `1916faa365f2788b6e193514872d51a242876569`, `7cb42f57561c321ecb09b4552802ae0ac55b3a7a`, `dc3d62a2181beb9f326952a2d212900c94f2e13d`
  - **New structural manifest signal**: `"preinstall": "bun run index.js"` in a `package.json` script value (the May 19 install vector), and `github:antvis/G2#<sha>` in any dependency-section value where `<sha>` matches one of the three known orphan commits
  - **New payload SHA-256**: `a68dd1e6a6e35ec3771e1f94fe796f55dfe65a2b94560516ff4ac189390dfa1c` (the 498KB obfuscated Bun bundle); added to `MALICIOUS_HASHLIST` and to the priority-files filter in `check_file_hashes` so the hash is computed even inside `node_modules`
- **Dead-man's-switch detection extended to the `kitty-monitor` variant**: The May 19 wave renames the persistence daemon from `gh-token-monitor` (May 11) to `kitty-monitor` and adds a GitHub dead-drop fetcher at `~/.local/share/kitty/cat.py`. The same wipe-on-token-revocation trigger semantics apply. The detector now recognises:
  - `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.kitty-monitor.plist` (macOS LaunchAgent)
  - `~/.config/systemd/user/kitty-monitor.service` (Linux systemd user unit)
  - `~/.local/bin/kitty-monitor.sh` (the daemon script)
  - `~/.config/kitty-monitor/` and `~/.config/kitty-monitor/token`
  - `~/.local/share/kitty/cat.py` (the dead-drop fetcher)
  - `/var/tmp/.gh_update_state` (execution-state tracker)
  - The same artifacts inside the scan tree (covers staged install kits and backups of compromised home directories), via an extended in-tree-artifact regex
  - `--check-host` now warns about the kitty-monitor variant with the same CRITICAL "stop service before rotating tokens" remediation order
- **Test fixtures**:
  - `test-cases/atool-attack/index.js` (new): synthetic payload file carrying every May 19 content IoC as inert string constants (C2 domain, beacon, forged-author email, three orphan-commit SHAs, `firedalazer`, `kitty-monitor` reference, `/var/tmp/.gh_update_state`, the `atool` publisher fingerprint). Inert by construction — string assignments only.
  - `test-cases/atool-attack/package.json` (extended): now also carries an `optionalDependencies` entry pointing at `github:antvis/G2#1916faa365…` to exercise the orphan-commit structural check
  - `test-cases/mini-shai-hulud-dead-mans-switch/kitty-monitor.sh`, `com.user.kitty-monitor.plist`, `kitty/cat.py` (new): inert filename-match fixtures for the kitty-monitor variant
- **`run-tests.sh` content-IoC assertion block**: 13 new tests that lock in each May 19 IoC's detection (10 against `atool-attack`, 3 against `mini-shai-hulud-dead-mans-switch`). Each test runs the detector on the relevant fixture and asserts a specific substring appears in the output, so any regression that silently breaks one of the new content checks fails CI.

### Changed
- **`MALICIOUS_HASHLIST`** size: 10 → 11 (added the May 19 payload hash).
- **`collect_all_files`** file collection: added `kitty-monitor.sh`, `com.user.kitty-monitor.plist`, `kitty-monitor.service`, `cat.py` to the `find` clause so the in-tree artifact regex can pick them up.
- **`check_file_hashes`** priority-files regex: extended with `kitty-monitor\.sh` and `cat\.py` so the new payload is hashed even when buried inside `node_modules`.
- **Test count**: 58 → 71 (+13 new content-IoC assertions; package-list and dead-man's-switch fixture exit-code expectations unchanged).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Mini Shai-Hulud AntV/atool wave coverage**: Added 643 malicious version artifacts across 323 distinct npm packages published by the compromised `atool` npm account on 2026-05-19. This is a new supply chain attack campaign distinct from prior waves and warrants a minor version bump. Vendors describe the timing slightly differently — SafeDep observed two automated waves at 01:39-01:56 UTC and 02:05-02:06 UTC; Socket and StepSecurity describe a single 22-minute burst beginning ~01:56 UTC and continuing through ~02:56 UTC. The campaign hit the `@antv/*` ecosystem hardest (~177 scoped packages), also pulled in `@openclaw-cn`, `@starmind`, and `@lint-md` namespaces, and the high-traffic standalone libraries `size-sensor` (4.2M downloads/month), `echarts-for-react` (3.8M downloads/month), `@antv/scale` (2.2M downloads/month), `timeago.js` (1.15M downloads/month), and `canvas-nest.js`. Aggregate impact ~16M weekly downloads. The payload is a 498KB single-line obfuscated Bun bundle delivered via a `preinstall: bun run index.js` hook (one observed SHA256: `a68dd1e6a6e35ec3771e1f94fe796f55dfe65a2b94560516ff4ac189390dfa1c`) that steals 20+ credential types — GitHub/CI tokens, AWS keys, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes service accounts, Vault tokens, SSH keys, Docker creds, DB connection strings — and attempts Docker container escape via the host socket. Primary exfiltration is HTTPS POST to `t.m-kosche.com:443/api/public/otel/v1/traces` with AES-256-GCM payload encryption and RSA-OAEP key wrapping; the GitHub-repo-creation channel (`{dune-word}-{dune-word}-{0-999}`) is a fallback that writes stolen data to `results/results-<timestamp>-<counter>.json`. Every exfil repo is tagged with the beacon string `niagA oG eW ereH :duluH-iahS` (character-reversed "Shai-Hulud: Here We Go Again"). Persistence via `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart` hooks, `.vscode/tasks.json` `folderOpen` tasks, and a `kitty-monitor` systemd/LaunchAgent unit running `~/.local/share/kitty/cat.py`. Imposter commits planted in `antvis/G2` were forged to appear as `huiyu.zjt <huiyu.zjt@ant.com>` (a real maintainer). Some vendors attribute to TeamPCP (the actor behind the May 12 TanStack wave); Socket and StepSecurity have not asserted attribution.

- **Test fixtures** (`test-cases/atool-attack/`, `test-cases/atool-clean/`): An attack fixture containing 5 compromised versions from the wave (`size-sensor@1.0.4`, `echarts-for-react@3.0.7`, `@antv/scale@0.6.2`, `timeago.js@4.1.2`, `@antv/g2@5.5.8`) plus the malicious `preinstall: bun run index.js` script, and a paired clean fixture using the last-known-good versions of the same packages (`size-sensor@1.0.3`, `echarts-for-react@3.0.6`, `@antv/scale@0.5.2`, `timeago.js@4.0.2`) to lock in that the detector flags the attack as HIGH and leaves legitimate consumers untouched.
- **`run-tests.sh` expected results**: Registered `atool-attack` (HIGH) and `atool-clean` (clean) in the `EXPECTED` table so regressions to either side of the new coverage will fail CI.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Bulk-mode unreadable-directory reporting**: `--bulk` discovery now records directories it could not read (chmod-000 / chmod-700-owned-by-someone-else / find permission errors) instead of silently dropping them. The unreadable paths are surfaced in three places: on stderr from `--bulk-list`, in the on-console `BULK SCAN SUMMARY` section under "Unreadable (permission denied)", and in a new "Unreadable directories" section of `aggregate-report.md`. The scan exit code is unaffected — this is informational only — but a real audit now sees which directories were invisible to it instead of falsely concluding nothing was missed.
- **Bulk-mode regression tests**: Two new tests in `run-tests.sh` lock in the hardenings: one builds a tree with a chmod-000 project and asserts that the path appears in `--bulk-list` (stderr) and in the aggregate report; the other points `--bulk-output` at a directory inside the scan root with leftover prior-run content and asserts that the output directory is excluded from discovery (so previous-run report files are never re-scanned as fake projects).

### Fixed
- **`--bulk-output` self-reference when placed inside a scan root**: if `--bulk-output` resolved to a path inside one of the `--bulk` scan roots, the output directory itself was treated as a scan target. On first run this just inflated the scanned count; on repeat runs the prior run's `aggregate-report.md` and `per-repo/*.console.txt` files (which legitimately quote attack indicator strings) could trigger content-pattern false positives. The output directory is now resolved to an absolute path before discovery starts and excluded from candidate consideration, both at the top-level discovery loop and inside `_bulk_discover`'s recursive descent.
- **Bulk-mode silent permission-denied skips**: `find` errors during discovery were redirected to `/dev/null`, and the discovery loop's `cd "$child" && pwd` step silently dropped any directory whose read or execute bit was unset. These paths are now captured into a per-run accumulator (`find` stderr lines parsed for the macOS and GNU "Permission denied" formats, plus a parallel record of directories that fail our subsequent readability check) and merged into a sorted, de-duplicated list that is shown to the user.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **`--bulk` mode**: Scan every project under one or more parent directories in a single invocation and write one aggregate report instead of running the detector by hand for each project. Each project is scanned as an isolated subprocess (one fresh process per project, re-invoked through the same Bash interpreter), so per-project global state never bleeds across scans and the existing `--save-log` contract and exit codes are reused verbatim. `--bulk` is purely additive — single-directory invocations behave exactly as before.
  - **Project discovery**: The positional arguments to `--bulk` are treated as *parent* directories. Under each, the detector descends to find the actual projects: a directory that contains a `.git` directory/worktree file or a recognised manifest/lockfile (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `requirements*.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Package.swift`) is taken as one scan unit (so **monorepos are scanned whole**, never split per workspace package); a directory with no marker of its own but with projects beneath it (a "bucket" folder like `~/dev/apps/<project>` or `~/work/clients/<client>/<project>`) is descended into recursively; a folder with no projects anywhere beneath it is scanned as-is so content-pattern checks still run. `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `coverage`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `site-packages`, hidden directories, etc. are never descended into. The detector's own repository is skipped automatically (its `test-cases/` fixtures are intentionally malicious).
  - **`--bulk-depth N`** (default `3`): caps how many directory levels below each parent the bucket-descent goes. A directory that already looks like a project is taken whole regardless of depth; the cap only limits descent through nested bucket folders. `--bulk-depth 1` reproduces a flat "one entry per immediate subdirectory" scan.
  - **`--bulk-list`**: with `--bulk`, prints the projects that would be scanned (one absolute path per line) and exits without scanning or writing a report — useful as a dry run before a long bulk scan.
  - **`--bulk-output DIR`** (default `./shai-hulud-bulk-report-<timestamp>/`): where the report is written. The directory is created only once at least one project has been discovered, so a `--bulk` run that finds nothing (e.g. a missing parent directory) leaves no stray output directory behind.
  - **Aggregate report**: `aggregate-report.md` (header metadata, a result-summary table, a per-project results table, per-project findings detail with the flagged paths and a collapsible console excerpt, a clean-projects list, a skipped list, and the exact command to re-run) plus `per-repo/<project>.findings.log` (flagged paths grouped by severity, same format as `--save-log`) and `per-repo/<project>.console.txt` (the full plain-text per-project scan output, ANSI-stripped) for every project. `--paranoid`, `--check-semver-ranges`, `--ecosystem`, `--parallelism`, and the grep-tool flags are passed through to every per-project scan.
  - **Exit code**: `--bulk` aggregates the per-project results — `1` if any project is high-risk, else `2` if any is medium-risk, else `3` if any per-project scan failed to complete, else `0`.
- **`run-tests.sh` bulk-mode tests**: project-discovery assertions via `--bulk --bulk-list` (bucket expansion, monorepos kept whole, `node_modules` / nested non-projects skipped), the `--bulk-depth 1` flat behaviour, an end-to-end `--bulk` run on a synthetic project tree (aggregate report structure, per-project logs, HIGH finding recorded, exit-code aggregation), and the "no stray output directory on a missing parent" behaviour.

### Changed
- **`run-tests.sh` `timeout` dependency is now optional**: the suite uses `timeout` / `gtimeout` when available and runs without a per-test time limit (with a note) when neither is installed, so the full suite passes on macOS without GNU coreutils.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **PyPI Ecosystem Support**: The detector now scans Python projects in addition to npm. PyPI manifests and lockfiles are parsed for compromised packages using the same set-intersection lookup the npm path uses. PyPI support is purely additive: npm-only projects scan exactly as before with no new findings, flags, or output changes that affect existing CI/CD pipelines.
- **Pure-Bash Python Parsers** (no runtime dependencies; awk-based, cross-platform):
  - `requirements.txt` and `requirements-*.txt` exact pins (`==X.Y.Z`)
  - `pyproject.toml` PEP 621 `[project] dependencies = [...]` arrays
  - `pyproject.toml` Poetry `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` and `[tool.poetry.group.*.dependencies]` tables
  - `Pipfile` `[packages]` / `[dev-packages]` sections
  - `Pipfile.lock` (JSON) `default` / `develop` sections
  - `poetry.lock` `[[package]]` blocks
  - `uv.lock` `[[package]]` blocks
  - PEP 503 name normalization (lowercase, `-`/`_`/`.` collapsed to `-`) applied before lookup
- **Ecosystem Auto-Detection**: New `detect_ecosystems` function scans the file inventory for ecosystem marker files (`package.json` / lockfiles for npm; `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` for PyPI) and runs only the relevant ecosystem-specific checks. Marker discovery excludes `node_modules`, `.venv`, `venv`, `.tox`, and `site-packages` directories.
- **Ecosystem Banner**: A new informational line at scan start prints which ecosystems were detected (for example: `Detected ecosystems: npm (12 marker file(s)), pypi (2 marker file(s))`). When neither ecosystem is detected, content-pattern checks still run.
- **`--ecosystem` CLI Flag**: Optional override. Accepts `npm`, `pypi`, `all`, or a comma-separated list. Default is auto-detect; the flag is purely opt-in and existing invocations continue to work unchanged.
- **Ecosystem Dispatch Table**: New `ECOSYSTEM_CHECK_FUNCTIONS` associative array maps each ecosystem to its check function(s). The dispatcher in `main()` walks `ACTIVE_ECOSYSTEMS` and invokes whatever the table lists, so adding a new ecosystem (Hex, Go, Cargo, RubyGems, etc.) requires zero changes to `main()` — only a row in the marker tables, a row in the dispatch table, a parser, a check function, and a loader-prefix branch. Order of execution honors the order of `ACTIVE_ECOSYSTEMS` (auto-detect mode preserves the prior npm-before-pypi order; `--ecosystem=pypi,npm` lets the user override execution order if needed).
- **PyPI Compromised Packages**: Added 11 confirmed malicious PyPI version artifacts across 6 distinct projects attributed to the TeamPCP threat actor:
  - May 2026 Mini Shai-Hulud cross-ecosystem spread: `pypi:mistralai:2.4.6`, `pypi:guardrails-ai:0.10.1` (Socket-confirmed)
  - April 2026 Mini Shai-Hulud PyPI sub-wave: `pypi:lightning:2.6.2`, `pypi:lightning:2.6.3` (Aikido / Socket / Semgrep / StepSecurity / Sonatype / Lightning AI official postmortem; note: only the `lightning` PyPI dist was affected — the legacy `pytorch-lightning` dist has no 2.6.2/2.6.3 release)
  - April 2026 TeamPCP Xinference compromise: `pypi:xinference:2.6.0`, `pypi:xinference:2.6.1`, `pypi:xinference:2.6.2` (three consecutive releases April 22, 2026; GitGuardian / JFrog)
  - March 2026 TeamPCP Telnyx compromise: `pypi:telnyx:4.87.1`, `pypi:telnyx:4.87.2` (Akamai / The Hacker News / official team-telnyx/telnyx-python issue #235)
  - March 2026 TeamPCP LiteLLM compromise: `pypi:litellm:1.82.7`, `pypi:litellm:1.82.8` (Datadog Security Labs / Sonatype / Truesec / Snyk)
- **Compromised Packages File Format**: The `compromised-packages.txt` format now accepts an optional `ecosystem:` prefix (`npm:` or `pypi:`). Bare entries continue to be interpreted as `npm` for full backward compatibility with external tools that consume this file.
- **PyPI Test Cases**:
  - Added `test-cases/pypi-attack-requirements/` to validate detection of `mistralai==2.4.6` in `requirements.txt`
  - Added `test-cases/pypi-attack-poetry/` to validate detection of `guardrails-ai==0.10.1` in both `pyproject.toml` (Poetry) and `poetry.lock`
  - Added `test-cases/polyglot-attack/` to validate auto-detection of both ecosystems and combined npm + PyPI compromise reporting in a single project
  - Added `test-cases/pypi-clean/` to confirm safe versions of campaign-targeted PyPI packages are not flagged

### Changed
- **Package Count**: Expanded `compromised-packages.txt` from 2,111 to 2,122 confirmed package versions (added 11 PyPI entries spanning four TeamPCP-attributed PyPI campaigns from March through May 2026).
- **Internal Map Keys**: `COMPROMISED_PACKAGES_MAP` keys are now ecosystem-prefixed internally (`npm:axios:1.14.1`, `pypi:mistralai:2.4.6`). The `is_compromised_package` helper accepts an optional second argument for ecosystem (default `npm`). External behavior is unchanged.
- **Test Suite Size**: 39 test cases (up from 35 before the 3.0.9 entry counted them; net of 4 new PyPI fixtures).
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` to describe ecosystem support, the `--ecosystem` flag, and the PyPI parsers.

### Security
- Added high-confidence detection for the May 2026 PyPI cross-ecosystem spread of the Mini Shai-Hulud / TanStack TheBeautifulSandsOfTime campaign and the earlier TeamPCP-attributed PyPI campaigns documented in:

### Fixed
- **Paranoid-mode hang on large projects with `node_modules`**: `check_typosquatting` and `check_network_exfiltration` previously iterated over every file in the inventory (including `node_modules`/`vendor`/build-output trees), spawning hundreds of thousands of `git grep` subprocesses on projects with bundled dependencies. Both functions now pre-filter their target lists to exclude `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `_build`, `deps`, `.next`, `coverage`, `site-packages`, `.venv`, and `venv` before iterating. Each function also now prints a scan-count banner so the effective workload is visible (e.g. `Scanning 49 files for network exfiltration (filtered from 14054 total)`). Result on a 42k-file Phoenix LiveView project with bundled `node_modules`: paranoid mode now completes in ~50 seconds; previously it ran past 2 minutes without exiting. The semantic for these heuristics matches industry convention (`npm audit`, Socket.dev): typosquatting and network-exfil checks examine *your* declared dependencies and code, not transitive deps already resolved inside `node_modules`.
- **`check_network_exfiltration` suspicious-domain regex false positives**: domain strings from the `suspicious_domains` array were interpolated into the grep regex without escaping their literal `.` characters. As a result, `t.me` matched `time`, `theme`, `tame`; `ix.io` matched any `ix<x>io`; `mega.nz` matched any `mega<x>nz`; etc. — producing false positives on common English words, HTML element names (`<time>`), and JSON descriptions. The fix introduces a `domain_esc` local that replaces every `.` with `\.` before interpolating into the regex, while preserving the unescaped `$domain` for the human-readable error message. Verified: legitimate `t.me` URLs (e.g. `https://t.me/abcd1234`, `const ENDPOINT = 't.me';`) still trigger the finding; bare words like `time`/`theme` no longer do.

### Compatibility
- Exit-code contract preserved: `0=clean`, `1=high-risk`, `2=medium-risk`. No new exit codes introduced.
- All existing CLI flags work identically. The new `--ecosystem` flag is optional with an auto-detect default; bare invocations (`./shai-hulud-detector.sh /path`) behave exactly as in 3.0.9.
- npm detection paths run unconditionally regardless of ecosystem detection. PyPI checks are the only ones gated on detection, ensuring zero behavior change for npm-only projects.
- `--save-log` output format unchanged (`# HIGH` / `# MEDIUM` / `# LOW` sections with file paths). PyPI findings are written into the same `# HIGH` section as npm compromised-package findings.
- Compromised-packages.txt format is backward-compatible: bare entries are still parsed as npm. Only new entries are prefixed.
- Pure Bash 5.x + POSIX shell tools; no new runtime dependencies. Tested on macOS Bash 5; same tool surface (awk, grep, find, sort, comm, cut, uniq, tr, xargs) as prior versions, ensuring continued support on Linux and Git Bash for Windows.

- **Dead-Man's-Switch Detection (`--check-host` flag, off by default)**:
  - When enabled, scans `$HOME` for `gh-token-monitor` persistence artifacts: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.gh-token-monitor.plist`, `~/.config/systemd/user/gh-token-monitor.service`, `~/.local/bin/gh-token-monitor.sh`, `~/.config/gh-token-monitor/token`
  - Always detects these artifacts when they appear inside the scan directory, regardless of `--check-host`
  - Findings include a CRITICAL warning that revoking the monitored GitHub token while the service is active is designed to trigger a destructive wipe; a safe remediation order is printed (stop service, delete files, verify no monitor process, then rotate tokens)

### Added
- **--check-semver-ranges flag**: Opt-in check for package.json semver ranges that could resolve to compromised versions (resolves GitHub issue #109)
  - Reports LOW risk as informational warning about latent risk (packages largely unpublished from npm)
  - Uses reverse lookup by package name for O(1) performance instead of O(n*packages)
  - Reuses dependency extraction from check_packages() - no additional file scanning

### Technical Details
- Added `COMPROMISED_VERSIONS_BY_NAME` associative array for efficient semver range checking
- Added `check_semver_ranges()` function that only runs when flag is passed
- Leverages existing `semver_match()` function that was previously unused

## [3.0.4] - 2025-12-03

### Changed
- **Default Grep Tool**: Changed default from ripgrep to git-grep for ~40% faster scanning on large codebases
- **Grep Tool Priority**: Auto-selection now follows: git-grep > ripgrep > grep (based on availability)

### Added
- **--use-git-grep flag**: Force use of git grep (DFA-based, no backtracking)

- Added `select_grep_tool()` function for auto-detection after argument parsing
- Flag overrides take priority over auto-detection
- Script exits with error if user-specified tool is not installed
- Updated `fast_grep_files()`, `fast_grep_files_i()`, `fast_grep_files_fixed()`, and `fast_grep_quiet()` to use case statements

## [3.0.3] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **Log File Output**: New `--save-log FILE` argument saves all detected file paths to a structured log file grouped by severity (resolves GitHub issue #104)
  - Output format: `# HIGH`, `# MEDIUM`, `# LOW` section headers followed by absolute file paths
  - No truncation - includes ALL findings regardless of display limits
  - Designed for CI/CD artifacts and programmatic parsing

### Changed
- **Usage Documentation**: Updated `--help` output and README.md with `--save-log` examples

### Technical Details
- Added `write_log_file()` function (lines 2098-2204) to generate structured log output

- Test suite expanded to 37 tests (34 original + 3 new `--save-log` tests)

## [3.0.2] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **TypeScript/Minified JS False Positives**: Replaced overly broad conditional patterns (`if.{1,200}credential...`) with tight Shai-Hulud 2.0 wiper signatures based on actual Koi Security malware disclosure (resolves GitHub issue #105)
- **Comment/Documentation False Positives**: Removed standalone glob patterns (`$HOME/*`, `~/*`) from `basic_destructive_regex` that were matching path examples in comments (e.g., TypeScript ESLint's `describeFilePath.js`)
- **Catastrophic Backtracking**: Simplified JS/Python destructive pattern matching to single-pass search, eliminating two-stage grep that caused script hangs on minified files (also resolves GitHub issue #99)

### Changed
- **Destructive Pattern Detection**: Now uses specific Shai-Hulud 2.0 wiper signatures:
  - `Bun.spawnSync` with `cmd.exe`/`bash` and destructive commands (`del /F`, `shred`, `cipher /W`)
  - `shred` with secure delete flags targeting `$HOME`
  - `cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%` (Windows secure wipe)
  - `del /F /Q /S` + `%USERPROFILE%`
  - `find $HOME ... shred`
  - `rd /S /Q` + `%USERPROFILE%`
- **Basic Destructive Patterns**: Retained command-context patterns (`rm -rf $HOME`, `find $HOME -delete`) while removing context-free glob patterns

### Security
- **Maintained Detection Efficacy**: All actual Shai-Hulud wiper code patterns still detected
- **Reduced False Positive Noise**: Projects with TypeScript, minified JS, or path documentation no longer trigger false CRITICAL alerts
- **Improved User Trust**: Clean scans on legitimate projects like Vue + TypeScript and highcharts

### Technical Details
- Replaced `js_py_conditional_regex` with `shai_hulud_wiper_regex` at line 773
- Removed `|\$HOME/[*]|~/[*]|/home/[^/]+/[*]` from `basic_destructive_regex` at line 769
- Simplified JS/Python pattern matching from two-stage grep to single-pass (lines 794-801)
- Updated test cases: `destructive-patterns/malicious_fallback.js` and `minified-false-positives/legitimate-destructive.js` to use actual wiper signatures
- Test suite remains at 34 passing tests

## [3.0.1] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- **Ripgrep Support**: Optional ripgrep (`rg`) integration for faster pattern matching when available (resolves GitHub issue #80)
- **Two-Phase Destructive Pattern Check**: Implemented two-phase detection with quick pre-filter followed by detailed analysis

### Fixed
- **Large Repository Crash**: Fixed xargs "argument list too long" crash on repositories with 77,531+ files by batching hash computation with `-n 100` (resolves GitHub issue #94)
- **Spaces in Filenames**: Fixed xargs crash when scanning files with spaces in their names by using null-delimited input throughout the script (resolves GitHub issue #92)
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fixed Git Bash and WSL/Linux compatibility issues (merged PR #88)
- **Network Exfiltration Comment Filtering**: Fixed comment filtering in network exfiltration detection (merged PR #81)

### Changed
- **Null-Delimited File Processing**: Updated `fast_grep_files()`, `fast_grep_files_i()`, `fast_grep_files_fixed()`, `check_file_hashes()`, `check_workflows()`, and `check_packages()` to use `tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0` pattern for robust filename handling
- **Batched Hash Computation**: Hash checking now processes files in batches of 100 to avoid shell argument limits on large codebases
- **Ripgrep Detection**: Script automatically detects and uses ripgrep if installed, falling back to grep otherwise

### Technical Details
- All file processing pipelines now use null-delimited input (`-0` flag) for xargs
- Hash computation uses `-n 100` batching combined with `-P "$PARALLELISM"` for efficient parallel processing
- Added `HAS_RIPGREP` detection with `command -v rg` for optional performance optimization
- Added test case `spaces-in-filenames` with files containing spaces to validate fix
- Test suite expanded to 34 test cases

## [3.0.0] - 2025-11-29

### Breaking Changes
- **Bash 5.0+ Required**: The script now requires Bash 5.0 or newer. On macOS, install via `brew install bash` and run with `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./shai-hulud-detector.sh`. Clear error message displayed when running on older Bash versions.

### Added
- **Automated Test Suite**: New `run-tests.sh` script validates all 32 test cases with expected exit codes and risk level detection (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **O(1) Package Lookups**: Replaced linear array searches with associative arrays for compromised package detection, dramatically improving performance on large projects
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added `set -eo pipefail` with proper `|| true` guards on all commands that may legitimately fail (grep, find, etc.)

### Changed
- **Lockfile Detection Rewrite**: Completely rewrote `check_package_integrity()` with AWK block-based JSON parsing instead of broken grep patterns. Now correctly detects compromised packages in lockfiles where package name and version are on different lines.
- **Modern Bash Features**: Leverages associative arrays (`declare -A`) and `mapfile` for improved performance and reliability
- **Cross-Platform Stat Abstraction**: Added `get_file_size()` and `get_file_mtime()` helper functions for macOS/Linux compatibility

### Fixed
- **Lockfile False Negatives**: Fixed critical bug where `chalk@5.6.1` and other compromised packages in lockfiles were not detected due to grep pattern assuming name and version on same line
- **Script Crashes Mid-Execution**: Fixed multiple grep pipeline failures that caused the script to exit with code 1 without completing the scan or showing results
- **Missing Ethereum Wallet Detection**: Restored Ethereum wallet address pattern detection (`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}`) that was lost during refactoring
- **Missing LOW RISK for Framework XMLHttpRequest**: Fixed detection to properly report LOW RISK for legitimate XMLHttpRequest modifications in React Native and Next.js framework code
- **Duplicate Lockfile Warnings**: Fixed AWK parser that was outputting duplicate findings for packages appearing in both node_modules and dependencies sections
- **Reduced False Positives for Destructive Patterns**: Standalone `rimraf`, `fs.unlinkSync`, and `fs.rmSync` no longer flagged as CRITICAL. Now only flags deletion commands that target user directories (`$HOME`, `~`, `/home/`) or are combined with credential/auth failure patterns. Fixed regex escaping for literal asterisk matching and excluded `~/path` patterns (Vue.js import aliases). Tightened `exec.*rm` pattern span to prevent false matches on minified code. (GitHub issue #74)

### Performance
- **Associative Array Lookups**: O(1) package lookups instead of O(n) linear searches

### Technical Details
- **Regex Improvements**:
  - Changed `find.*-delete` to `find[[:space:]]+[^[:space:]]+.*[[:space:]]+-delete` (requires proper command structure)
  - Limited conditional patterns to `.{1,200}` spans instead of unlimited `.*` to prevent false positives across minified files
  - Added command-specific contexts for JavaScript patterns (requires `rm -`, `fs.`, `rimraf`, etc.)
- **Permission Handling**: Modified `count_files()` function and all direct find usages to handle permission denied gracefully
- **SemVer Case Insensitive**: Changed wildcard pattern from `*x*` to `*[xX]*` and updated skip logic to handle both "x" and "X"
